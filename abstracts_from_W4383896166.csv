Kuhn', 'Richard Schlegel']","A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were-and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. And fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation, but that revolutions in those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of normal science, as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introductory essay by Ian Hacking that clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's essay provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science."

Indigenous communities have formed national and international peasant confederations, law centers, cultural centers, and, more recently, political parties and platforms. Challenging the historical image of Indians as a submissive, backward, and anachronistic group, these newly formed organizations have declared, embraced, and mobilized around their indigenous identity. Their demands have included territorial autonomy, respect for customary law, new forms of political representation, and bicultural education. While the specific characteristics of organizations and agendas vary, they have commonly demanded that constitutional, democratic, individual rights be respected and that collective indigenous rights be granted. Consequently, they are contesting the practice and terms of citizenship in Latin America's new democracies. The emergence of indigenous organizations, politicization of indigenous identities, and demand for indigenous rights over the past two decades challenge historical norms and scholarly conclusions about the politicization of ethnic cleavages in Latin America. The historical record suggests that in the twentieth century indigenous communities have rarely initiated or sustained social movements that proclaimed an indigenous identity and demanded indigenous rights. To the contrary, active rural organizing within and between indigenous communities has traditionally been the reserve of peasant unions, political parties, churches, and revolutionaries. These movements have historically attempted to mobilize Indians to forge class, partisan, religious and/or revolutionary identities over, and often against, indigenous ones. Accordingly, scholars have generally underscored the weak politicization of ethnic cleavages in Latin America and concluded that ethnicity in Latin America has had comparatively little explicit impact on political organizing, party platforms, debates, and conflict, in sharp contrast to other regions in the world. I The emergence of indigenous organizations that proclaim and promote indigenous identity and rights, therefore, constitutes a new phenomenon that merits explanation.2 This article addresses why indigenous identity has become a more salient basis of political organizing and source of political claims in Latin America by comparing rural politics since 1945 in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru."

Professor Banton's book is notable for its internationalism. It formulates principles that govern the development of relations between racial and ethnic groups everywhere, drawing upon case studies from across the globe. The arguments which organize this mass of evidence are taken from a rational choice theory of behaviour, combining elements from modern economics with older sociological interpretations. According to this theory, much turns on whether people, as they seek their economic and social goals, choose to compete as groups or individuals, for group competition reinforces any boundaries that are marked by physical difference, whereas individual competition dissolves them. Many of the concepts that have been used in racial and ethnic studies reflect the values of the more articulate groups in given societies at particular times. As the concepts of economics are less tied to varying cultures and circumstances, they can inform comparative history of racial relations in South Africa, the United States and Britain (as seen in three substantial chapters). They can also be used (as later chapters show) to illuminate the dynamics of racial discrimination in housing and employment markets, fitting the theory to the complexity of every-day transactions and bringing sociology into relation with social policy."

Sewell has reconstructed the artisans' world from the corporate communities of the old regime, through the revolutions in 1789 and 1830, to the socialist experiments of 1848. Research has revealed that the most important class struggles took place in craft workshops, not in 'dark satanic mills'. In the 1830s and 1840s, workers combined the collectivism of the corporate guild tradition with the egalitarianism of the revolutionary tradition, producing a distinct artisan form of socialism and class consciousness that climaxed in the Parisian Revolution of 1848. The book follows artisans into their everyday experience of work, fellowship, and struggles and places their history in the context of wider political, economic, and social developments. Sewell analyzes the 'language of labor' in the broadest sense, dealing not only with what the workers and others wrote and said about labour but with the whole range of institutional conventions, economic practices, social struggles, ritual gestures, customs, and actions that gave the workers' world a comprehensive shape."

Originally conceptualized as capturing acquired skills and declarative knowledge in different content domains, more recent definitions and typical indicators focus on verbal ability. We investigated the relationship between verbal ability and declarative knowledge under consideration of individual differences in fluid intelligence in a large-scale assessment study with 6,701 adolescents. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the factorial distinctness of verbal ability and declarative knowledge with three analytical strategies: (i) Estimating correlations between latent variables, (ii) estimating the amount of unique variance in each factor after accounting for differences in the other ability constructs, and (iii) investigating associations with covariates including school achievement, students’ characteristics, and psychological traits. The correlation between latent variables representing verbal ability, measured with items from six language domains, and knowledge in 16 content domains was very high (ρ = .91), but significantly different from unity. About 17% of the variance in the knowledge factor was independent of individual differences in verbal ability and fluid intelligence. Associations with covariates revealed unique correlational patterns for each ability construct. The findings suggest that verbal ability and knowledge are closely related, but empirically distinguishable facets of crystallized intelligence. The discussion focuses on the construct validity of verbal tests for the measurement of gc and the interpretation of the common factor of a broad knowledge assessment as a causal variable."

The boundary that separates the indigenous and non-indigenous population is known to be extremely fluid as it is based on characteristics that can easily change within a generation such as language use, cultural practices and a subjective sense of belonging. Using data from the Mexican census I examine the ethnic classification of children of indigenous parents. I find that movement across the ethnic boundary depends on which of the two criteria currently recognized by the Mexican census is used. Children of indigenous parents are much less likely to be classified as indigenous according to language proficiency, especially when their parents have higher levels of education. By contrast, when proxy self-identification is used as a criterion, children of indigenous parents are more likely to be classified as indigenous, and greater parental education actually results in higher odds that children will be classified as indigenous. The shift in children's indigenous classification with parental education is found to strongly affect estimates of educational disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous children."

We use new survey data to empirically examine how Muslim youth differ from older Muslims and non-Muslim British peers on religiosity, Islam-specific and broader social attitudes. We find that young Muslims attribute a greater salience to Islam for their personal identity, even though they pray and read scripture less, and support plural interpretations of Islam more than their elders. Like other youth, Muslim youth show liberalizing social attitudes across generations on gay marriage and legal abortion. Notably, like Christian youth, Muslim youth express stronger support for including religion in public debates than their elders.

Sue', 'Fernando Riosmena']","In recent decades, an increasing number of Latin American countries have included ethnoracial questions on their censuses, giving rise to unprecedented data on monoracial and multiracial forms of classification. In Mexico, the government launched a count of its black population for the first time in the nation’s history in 2015, in addition to its long-standing practice of enumerating its indigenous population. Most recently in 2018, it conducted a survey, again asking about both black and indigenous identification. Within this short time span, the black population grew from 1.8 percent to 5.9 percent, becoming a sizable, statistically visible minority. A large majority of black individuals also identified as indigenous, revealing an important form of dual-minority multiracialism. In this article, we analyze these unprecedented data, detailing the size, composition, and growth of these populations. We use the Mexican case to illustrate the potential implications of measuring ethnoracial inequality using single- versus dual-category approaches. We find that black disadvantage is considerably more pronounced when explicitly allowing for multiracial classification. Methodologically, our findings contribute to nascent conversations about how to incorporate the new social and statistical realities of multiracialism in inequality analyses. Theoretically, we expand the multiracialism literature from its traditional focus on part-white mixtures, to a focus on overlapping minority classification. Finally, we build on theories of intersectionality, which generally focus on intersections of oppression across multiple “master statuses” (e.g., race, class, and gender), by also examining intersecting oppressions within the single master status of race."

Mutuals embodied a vision of a decentralized, “cooperative commonwealth” of farmers, merchants and independent producers. And they rested on a socio-industrial order characterized by political struggles against corporations; anti-monopoly social movements; immigrants and other cultural carriers of mutual organizing templates; and an institutional infrastructure of protestant churches and local movements."

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature that uses internet data for demographic studies and presents a general framework for addressing the problem of selection bias in non-representative samples. Design/methodology/approach – The authors propose two main approaches to reduce bias. When ground truth data are available, the authors suggest a method that relies on calibration of the online data against reliable official statistics. When no ground truth data are available, the authors propose a difference in differences approach to evaluate relative trends. Findings – The authors offer a generalization of existing techniques. Although there is not a definite answer to the question of whether statistical inference can be made from non-representative samples, the authors show that, when certain assumptions are met, the authors can extract signal from noisy and biased data. Research limitations/implications – The methods are sensitive to a number of assumptions. These include some regularities in the way the bias changes across different locations, different demographic groups and between time steps. The assumptions that we discuss might not always hold. In particular, the scenario where bias varies in an unpredictable manner and, at the same time, there is no “ground truth” available to continuously calibrate the model, remains challenging and beyond the scope of this paper. Originality/value – The paper combines a critical review of existing substantive and methodological literature with a generalization of prior techniques.

Yet remarkably little of this discussion has been brought to bear on the workplace as an arena in which symbolic boundaries are established and maintained. I seek to fill this gap by applying theories of symbolic boundaries to the restructuring of work within a small sample of manufacturing plants located in disparate regions of the United States. Using qualitative methods, the study explores how the boundary work of high-status employees has shaped the division of labor within plants undergoing the introduction of automated production systems. Contrary to claims advanced by some theorists, my analysis suggests that specifically “cultural” boundaries, based on the deployment of refined or high-status knowledge, do indeed play a salient role at work, exerting a powerful effect on the outcome of workplace change in ways that skilled production workers find difficult to contest. These findings suggest that much more attention should be paid to the varied forms that cultural boundaries can assume at work, especially in an era in which formal knowledge operates as a powerful axis of class differentiation."

This article examines how one such agency, Brazil’s Directoria Geral de Estatística, worked to simultaneously measure and promote national progress from 1870 to 1920. The article documents a fundamental shift in this period in the DGE’s vision of the qualities of the population essential for Brazil’s progress as a nation. In the 1870s, the DGE saw educational statistics as the key measures of national progress and lobbied for government investment in primary schools to ensure the advancement of the nation. By the 1920s, the DGE looked instead to immigration and racial statistics to measure progress and advocated cultural and biological “whitening” of the population to improve the Brazilian nation. Analysis of a broad range of archival and published primary sources reveals the gradual racialization of the DGE’s institutional definition of “progress.” The study contributes to a growing body of research that examines how racial thought influenced the development and official practices of state agencies in Latin America."

The paper suggests that participant observation is an inappropriate technique for ethnographers for discovering native categories that must be otained to analyze the underlying rules that natives use to ascribe events, things, and persons to these categories.

That the Caucasians, who for a brief spell have surpassed the Japanese, will not hold their own, is based on the great difference in briths of the two groups, and on the fact that there is now more emigration than immigration of Caucasians. It must, however, be remembered that fairly soon (how uoos depends, as was noted at the outset, on economic factors) a balance between emigration and immigration will be reached. After that the Caucasians will maintain their population as much by immigration as by births, while the Japanese will have to maintain it by births exclusively. It has been shown by Dr. Lind that the Japanese birth rate has been coming down in the same manner as the birth rates of all immigrant groups who have entered America. Their crude birth rate is now (1947) 28.3 (births per thousand population), and is lower than that of the Part Hawaiians and Puerto Ricans, and about the same as that of the Chinese, Koreans, and Filipinos, but much higher than that of the Caucasians (16.2). In 1922 this rate was 48.1 for the Japanese. The crude birth rate is, however, not as good an index of fertility as a more refined rate, the number of births per 1,000 women, 15-44 years of age. Here the rate for the Japanese dropped from 170 in 1932 to 90 in 1940. The Filipinos in 1940 had the highest rate, 228; the Caucasians the lowest, 76. It is significant that the Japanese rate is much closer to the Caucasian rate than to the Filipino rate. These facts seem to indicate that the Japanese are gradually adopting the small family system character.stic of America and Western Europe. If this decline in Japanese birth rates and the increasing amount of Japanese out-breeding are given consideration, and it is remembered that immigration from Japan is impossible, we must come to the conc.usion that in a fairly short time the Japanese population, considered as a pure group, will have reached its highest point and will begin to decline. The effect of the war on the process was to add a bumper crop of children of mixed blood born in Hawaii. This added number will later when grown up have the effect of further hastening the process of mixing. We have not given any materials indicative of the attitudes of members of the various racial groups involved in these population changes, and particularly of the changes in attitudes the war has produced. The materials of the Social Research Laboratory bearing on these points will have to be presented elsewhere."

Comparing the experiences of rich and poor Asian immigrants to the United States, I discuss institu­ tional practices whereby nonwhite immigrants in the First World are simultaneously, though unevenly, subjected to twO processes of normalization: an ideological whitening or blackening that re­ flects dominant racial oppositions and an assessment of cultural competence based on imputed human capital and consumer power in the minority subject. Immigrants from Asia or poorer countries must daily negotiate the lines of difference established by state agencies as well as groups in civil society. A subsidiary point is that, increasingly, such modalities of citizen-making are influenced by transnational capitalism. Depending on their loca­ tions in the global economy, some immigrants of color have greater access than others to key institutions in state and civil society. Global citizenship thus-eonfers citizenship privileges in Western democracies to a degree that may help the immigrant to scale racial and cultwal heights but not to circumvent Status hi­ erarchy based on racial dUference.

The present paper was submitted n 1 96 and accepted 18 1 96; the final version reached the Editor's office 4 1II 96. In the fall of r970, I left Malaysia and arrived as a fresh­ man in New York City. I was immediately swept up in the antiwar movement. President Nixon had just begun his secret bombing of Cambodia. Joining crowds of angry students marching down Broadway, I paIticipated in the takeover of the East Asian Institute building on the Columbia University campus. As I stood there confronting policemen in riot gear, I thought about what Southeast Asia meant to the United States. Were South­ east Asians simply an anonymous mass of people in black pajamas? Southeast Asia was a faI-off place where America was conducting a savage war against commu­ nism. American lives were being lost, and so were those of countless Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians, and others. This rite of passage into American society was to shape my attitude towaId citizenship. As a for­ eign student I was at a disadvantage, ineligible for most loans, fellowships, and jobs. My sister, a naturalized American, could have sponsored me for a green card, but the bombing of Cambodia, symptomatic of widet disregard for my part of the world, made American citi­ zenship a difficult mo,.l issue for me. Much writing on citizenship has ignored such subjec­ tive and contradictory experiences, focusing instead on its broad legal-political aspects. For instance, Thomas Marshall (r9501 defines citizenship as a question of mo­ dernity, but he identifies it primarily in terms of the evolution of civil society and the working out of the tensions between the sovereign subject and solidarity in a nation-state. Other scholars have pointed to the con­ tradiction between democratic citizenship and capital­ ism-the opposition between abstract, universalistic rights and the inequalities engendered by market com­ petition, race, and immigration (Hall and Held r989, Potles and Rumbaut r 9901. But these approaches seldom examine how the universalistic criteria of democratic citizenship variously regulate different categories of sub­ jects or how these subjects' locatio!U>'ithin the nation­ state and within the global economy conditions the con­ struction of their citizenship. Indeed, even studies of citizenship that take into account the effects on it of capital accumulation and consumption have been con­ cerned with potential sltategies for political change to remake civil society (Yudice t995). Seldom is attention focused on the everyday processes whereby people, espe­ cially immigrants, aIe made into subjects of a particulaI nation-state. If Citizenship as Subjectification Taking an ethnographic approach, I consider Clllzen­ ship a cultural process of subject-ification,1I in the Fou­ caldian sense of self-making and being-made by power relations that produce consent through schemes of surveillance, discipline, control, and administration (Foucault t989, 199tl. Thus formulated, my concept of cultural cilizenship can be applied to various global con­ texts (see Ong r993, Ong and Nonini t996), but in this papel I will discu'ss the making of cultural citizens in 1.

W2002991392,1744-2222,['Douglas S. Massey'],Economic development is associated with modernization urbanization internal rural-urban migration and international migration. Emigration is positively associated with development and aid to developing countries will increase emigration from those countries until the developing country reaches a standard of living equal to that of the developed country. Studies of European emigration to America have shown that emigration is correlated with the onset of industrialization and that emigration was highest when the home country was experiencing a depression and the US economy was in a period of upswing. The basis of society in an underdeveloped country is labor-intensive subsistence farming which provides work and sustenance to a household or community. As soon as capital is applied to agriculture the small peasant holdings are replaced by large private holdings efficiently farmed by machinery and producing surpluses that find their way to markets that is to urban areas which represent concentrations of wealth. The fabric of agricultural society is destabilized as the peasant owner becomes a hired laborer who migrates to the urban area when farms need fewer and factories more laborers. The 1st phase of migration is thus rural to urban. But development is discontinuous both in time and in space and when the displaced worker cannot find employment in the cities of his own country he emigrates to another. Transportation and communication facilities developed to facilitate industrial and commercial exchange also serve as carriers of international migration usually to the same country with which close economic links have already been established. International migration feeds on itself because earlier immigrants provide a network that makes resettlement easier cheaper and less risky for the next wave of migrants. Moreover the emigrants send money back to the home country which helps to speed up the development process in the home country until modernization and urbanization reach the point where there are no more displaced peasants to export. The experience of the United States and Mexico illustrates most phases of the emigration cycle. The 1st wave of Mexican emigration to the US lasted from 1900 to 1929 when the US economy was growing and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1919) devastated the Mexican economy. In the 1930s Mexico experienced a period of rapid growth. The 2nd wave of emigration 1942-1964 stemmed from the coincidence of drought in Mexico and wartime labor shortage in the US which was remedied by the bracero program which granted temporary visas to Mexican agricultural workers. The 3rd and current wave of emigration began in the mid-1960s. It was fueled by the Mexican governments ambitious economic reform program which was to be paid for out of oil revenues. When oil prices fell the Mexican economy suffered a crisis of inflation and debt. However the development process in Mexico is reaching the stage where there are no longer large numbers of surplus agricultural workers and Mexican emigration should diminish over the next 2 decades.

The author delineates two gendered cultural structures: the family devotion schema and the work devotion schema. Respondents are caught in the conflict between each schema's competing vision of a worthwhile life. Older respondents are more likely to accept the devotion schema's definition of an irreconcilable conflict between work and family, prompting many to avoid marriage or childbearing. In contrast, many members of the youngest cohort, who came of age after the early 1970s women's movement, are refashioning the family devotion schema by subcontracting out domestic responsibilities while maintaining demanding careers. Yet, the family devotion schema continues to haunt all cohorts, enduring in its cognitive, normative, and emotional power. Gender, as expressed in cultural models of family, remains a powerful constraint on the hearts and minds of even professionally successful women."

Hence, the way in which social psychology approaches the matter of self-categorization provides a touchstone for its politics. To the extent that we too take categories for granted, we are in danger of supporting conservative and undemocratic politics. The only way to eschew tendencies toward reification within social psychology is to add a historical dimension to our own analysis of self-categorical processes."

However, in an experiment with 288 high-caste and 294 low-caste students in India, cues to one's place in the caste system turned out to starkly influence the expression of these traits. The experiment allows us to discriminate between two classes of models that give different answers to the question of how someone's identity affects his behavior. Models of the fixed self assume that identity is a set of preferences. Models of the frame-dependent self assume that identity entails a set of mental models that are situationally evoked and that mediate information processing. Our findings suggest that the effect of identity on intellectual performance depends sensitively on the social setting. This perspective opens up new policy options for enhancing human capital formation and development."

These puzzles include the simplification of children's origins by parents who each have a different single ethnic origin, inconsistencies in the ethnic origins that parents ascribe to their children, and changes in the pattern of ancestry responses across the life span of individuals. Through careful analysis of the pattern of reporting of ethnic ancestry, we explore whether these puzzles are due to technical inadequacies of census design or to true substantive changes in the conceptualization of ethnic origin among whites in the U.S. For those changes we determine to be primarily substantive, we explore the social forces shaping the observed changes and some of the consequences of these changes for the size and composition of ethnic ancestry groups in the U.S. We also outline the implications of some of these changes for future empirical research and theorizing on ethnicity."

Given world immigration patterns, many countries face a growing dilemma in determining the cultural antecedents of their populations. A further complication is the reality that such determination occurs within the political and nationalistic settings where ethnic‐cultural groups may be potent forces in their own right. As societies mature and evolve, there is an increasing tendency for populations, especially those with many generations of residence in the country, to see themselves as ‘indigenous’ to the society in which they live. Canada is not alone in having to deal with the fluidity of the concept, ‘Canadian’, ‘American’, ‘Australian’, ‘Yugoslav’, and ‘Soviet’ are parallel concepts in other countries of multiple ethnic composition. Using 1991 National Census Test results, the article explores some of the parameters of the indigenous category ‘Canadian’. In particular, the location in Canada and mother tongue of respondents reporting ‘Canadian’ as the ethnic origin of their parents and grandparents or as their own ethnic identity are important indicators for this emerging ethnic category."

When such factors are also associated with socioeconomic outcomes such as earnings, estimates of the disadvantage experienced by individuals because of how they identify racially obtained from standard regression models may be biased. We illustrate this potential bias using data from a large-scale survey conducted by the Mexican census bureau. This survey is the first by the government agency since the country’s independence to include a question on black identification. We find evidence of a substantial bias in estimates of racial disadvantage. Results from our initial models treating racial self-identification as an exogenous predictor indicate that black men have higher earnings than non-black men. However, when we use an instrumental variables model that treats racial self-identification as endogenous, that is, as a function of the same unobserved characteristics as individuals’ earnings, we find a significant negative effect of black identification on earnings. While previous studies have acknowledged the endogeneity of race, ours is the first to explicitly model racial self-identification as an endogenous predictor to obtain an unbiased estimate of its effect on individuals’ socioeconomic conditions."

In this article, drawing on theories of boundary formation, I compare these two forms of identification to explore the salience and social closure of racial boundaries. Specifically, I analyze race-reporting inconsistency and predict college completion at multiple levels of racial ancestry aggregation using Census data. The results suggest that, while much of the variation in these measures corresponds to popular “big race” conceptions of difference, considerable variation remains among individual ancestries."

The chapter also analyzes the evolution and dynamics of indigenous poverty in Mexico between 1992 and 2002, plus the changing demographics, labour market participation and human development achievements of the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, in order to assess whether the economic and social gaps between them are narrowing or widening."

It was also confronted with racist connotations which, in the early 19th century, included the ideas of progress and modernity, hence the difficulty in legitimizing its own ‘brand of mestizaje.’ We will address these issues through empirical examination of two contexts in Mexico: the State and City of Veracruz, and Costa Chica on the Pacific coast of the States of Oaxaca and Guerrero. Strongly associated with Mexican national identity, what these two case studies share is the issue of mestizaje from the standpoint of the African presence which, though considerable from the start of colonization, was not included in ‘classic’ views of national mestizaje. This analysis helps reveal various ways in which populations of African origin were incorporated into the Nation. Thus, we can see how the local configuration articulates with the overall discourse to privilege one facet or dimension of (cultural, or social, or political) Afro identification over another."

In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories."

Results focus on the psychometric characteristics of the 2-item scales on the BFI-10, including their part-whole correlations with the BFI-44 scales, retest reliability, structural validity, convergent validity with the NEO-PI-R and its facets, and external validity using peer ratings. Overall, results indicate that the BFI-10 scales retain significant levels of reliability and validity. Thus, reducing the items of the BFI-44 to less than a fourth yielded effect sizes that were lower than those for the full BFI-44 but still sufficient for research settings with truly limited time constraints."

This article presents a hypothesis and evidence that humans process ethnic groups (and a few other related social categories) as if they were species because their surface similarities to species make them inputs to the livingkinds mental module that initially evolved to process specieslevel categories. The main similarities responsible are (1) categorybased endogamy and (2) descentbased membership. Evolution encouraged this because processing ethnic groups as speciesat least in the ancestral environmentsolved adaptive problems having to do with interactional discriminations and behavioral prediction. Coethnics (like conspecifics) share many strongly intercorrelated properties that are not obvious on first inspection. Since interaction with outgroup members is costly because of coordination failure due to different norms between ethnic groups, thinking of ethnic groups as species adaptively promotes interactional discriminations towards the ingroup (including endogamy). It also promotes inductive generalizations, which allow acquisition of reliable knowledge for behavioral prediction without too much costly interaction with outgroup members. The relevant cognitivescience literature is reviewed, and cognitive fieldexperiment and ethnographic evidence from Mongolia is advanced to support the hypothesis."

Yet despite the volume of material produced, this period has not seen a notable increase in theoretical sophistication in the field (Drummond 1983:803; Young 1983). For the most part students of ethnicity remain mired in antique arguments about motivation that obscure as much as they illuminate. The following discussion attempts to break through some entrenched conceptual blinders by drawing on the theory of practice outlined by Pierre Bourdieu (1977). This theory avoids the explanatory gaps and fallacious reasoning and at the same time allows richer interpretations of ethnic phenomena, individual and collective, than do conventional models of ethnicity. Since individual and collective expressions of ethnicity have elicited divergent theoretical treatments, the practice theory of ethnicity promises to give new unity to a fragmented field of study."

Discussion of the presumed conflict might be clarified by discussing this hypothesis in some detail. Before doing so, it should be noted that we deliberately use the term ethnicity in preference to tribalism, and we shall preface our remarks by carefully defining our use of the term ethnicity. In a traditional, rural setting, an individual is a member first of all of a family and then of a tribe.2 The demands the tribe makes on him vary with the complexity of the tribal system of government,3 as does the degree to which family and tribal loyalties are distinct.

First, Parsons's Structure of Social Action is scrutinized. It is shown that Parsons so construes Hobbes that the ""problem of order"" for social theory is answered by the concept of internalized normative motivation. As a consequence of this focus, Parsons derogates an analytically independent ""cognitive"" element in action and elegates cognitive matters either to the ""scientific"" or ""normative"" orientations. Second, the interrelated series of articles by Pope, Cohen, and Hazelrigg are shown to rest on framework assumptions similar to Parsons's own, while drawing nearly opposite conclusions, rendering Durkheim a ""positivist"" and Weber a ""utilitarian"" in Parsons's sense of these terms. Third, a ""redefined theory of action"" is proposed which acknowledges explicitly the analytically independent role of the cognitive element in action. Some course-of-action statements drawn from Durkheim and Weber and focusing on the cognitive structuring of the ""situation"" and of ""end"" are presented and shown to involve compatible reasoning.

Similarly, in popular media, “colorism,” or discrimination based on skin lightness, is rarely mentioned. When colorism is discussed, it is almost exclusively framed in terms of intraracial “black-on-black” discrimination. In line with arguments highlighting the centrality of white racism, the present paper contends that it is important for researchers to give unique attention to white colorism. Using data from the 2012 American National Election Study, an example is presented on white interviewers’ perceptions of minority respondent skin tone and intelligence ( N = 223). Results from ordinal logistic regression analyses indicate that African American and Latino respondents with the lightest skin are several times more likely to be seen by whites as intelligent compared with those with the darkest skin. The article concludes that a full accounting of white hegemony requires an acknowledgment of both white racism and white colorism."

Both inside and outside the People's Republic of China, provincialism has often been held to challenge the unity of the Chinese state. However, an examination of the provincial discourse of development in Shanxi during the 1990s suggests that provincial and indeed more local identity politics are more complex and finely nuanced than might at first seem to be the case. Shanxi's new provincial identity was neither exclusive nor opposed to other identities, but one of a series of multiple and overlapping identities, structured within a hierarchy of place and identity that reached down to and interacted with the more local levels of county and village, as well as up to the national level. At the same time it is clear that the appeal to localism has started to influence the ways in which provincial leaders participate in national politics. Moreover, there is some indication that the emphasis on localism may have resulted in the county and the town or city becoming more significant locales for identity formation than the province, though the consequences of this for provincial and local politics remain unclear."

These ideal types are unquestionably useful heuristic tools. Yet their conceptual utility is often undermined when researchers place them at opposite ends of a linear, historical transformation in which mass media technology is believed to supplant interpersonal communication and the locations in which it occurs. This article abandons the polar, historical relationship in favor of a communication dialectic that recognizes the synthesis of ideal types into composite forms of interaction. Embedded technology demonstrates the dialectic by exploring how electronic media fixed within a physical location can combine with the interpersonal communication taking place there to enhance group interaction. The resulting hybrid defies the assumption that mass media simply displace interpersonal interaction, pointing instead to a dialectic relationship in which ideal types continually challenge and transform one another."

We first discuss the nature of the ISCO88 classification and its relationship to national classifications used around the world and also to its predecessor, ISCO68 (ILO, 1969), which has been widely utilized in comparative research. We argue that comparative research would gain much from adopting ISCO88 as the standard tool of classification and provide guidance on how to do this. We then outline the procedures we have used to generate new standard recodes for three internationally comparable measures of occupational status: Treiman's Standard International Occupational Prestige Scale (SIOPS), Ganzeboom et al.'s International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), and Erikson and Goldthorpe's class categories (EGP). To update the SIOPS prestige scores we have directly matched the occupational titles in the SIOPS scale to the categories of the ISCO88 classification. For ISEI scores we have replicated the procedure used to create scores for the ISCO68 categories, employing the same data but using newly developed matches between the underlying national occupational classifications and ISCO88. To construct the EGP class codes we have mapped the ISCO88 occupation categories into a 10-category classification developed by the CASMIN project for a 12-country analysis. To validate these scales, we estimated parameters of a basic status-attainment model from an independent source of data: the pooled file from the International Social Justice Project (a large international data file that combines data from sample surveys in 14 countries). Estimates based on occupational status scales derived from ISCO88 and ISCO68 are highly similar."

Despite—or perhaps because of—the sprawl of different treatments of identity in the social sciences, the concept has remained too analytically loose to be as useful a tool as the literature’s early promise had suggested. We propose to solve this longstanding problem by developing the analytical rigor and methodological imagination that will make identity a more useful variable for the social sciences. This article offers more precision by defining collective identity as a social category that varies along two dimensions—content and contestation. Content describes the meaning of a collective identity. The content of social identities may take the form of four non-mutually-exclusive types: constitutive norms; social purposes; relational comparisons with other social categories; and cognitive models. Contestation refers to the degree of agreement within a group over the content of the shared category. Our conceptualization thus enables collective identities to be compared according to the agreement and disagreement about their meanings by the members of the group. The final section of the article looks at the methodology of identity scholarship. Addressing the wide array of methodological options on identity—including discourse analysis, surveys, and content analysis, as well as promising newer methods like experiments, agent-based modeling, and cognitive mapping—we hope to provide the kind of brush clearing that will enable the field to move forward methodologically as well."

A literature review of research examining skin tone bias, drawing largely from work examining perceptions of Blacks in the United States, reveals that individuals with features typical of members of their racial category are perceived and treated more negatively by social perceivers. Furthermore, this treatment has broad implications for social status and health. Despite this evidence, the tendency to attend to and use within-race variation in phenotypic appearance has been over-looked in social psychological models of impression formation. However, several theoretical frameworks have recently been proposed to explain the role of phenotype-based expectancies in social representation and judgment. Drawing on the strengths of each perspective, a rudimentary model of racial phenotypicality bias is proposed. This analysis suggests that future examinations guided by the current framework (or similar others) can complement existing evidence toward a greater understanding of the role of phenotypic variation in social perception."

One theoretical model proposes that some psychological salience of subgroup categories is necessary to facilitate the generalization of attitude change beyond the immediate contact situation. Another argues that a re-categorization of the subgroups into a new superordinate category is more beneficial, whilst a third suggests that de-categorizing the situation entirely is optimal. An alternative view, which combines the first two models, proposes a Dual Identity strategy (simultaneous high superordinate and high subgroup categorization) as an important mediator of the relationship between contact variables and intergroup attitudes. In the study, participants (N = 114) undertook a cooperative intergroup task under four conditions of category salience: ‘subgroup’, ‘superordinate’, ‘superordinate and subgroup’, and ‘no group salience’. Evaluative ratings and symbolic reward allocations both for the groups encountered (contact) and those outside the situation (generalization) provided measures of intergroup bias. Bias within the contact situation was mainly eliminated in all conditions. However, on the more generalized bias measures, only the ‘superordinate’ and ‘superordinate and subgroup’ (Dual Identity strategy) conditions maintained this low level; in the other two conditions intergroup bias resurfaced.

First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5% of black children grow up in such areas.

Taking as its starting point the seminal volume edited by Gerholm and Lithman—The New Islamic Presence in Western Europe (1988)—the paper reviews continuities and changes in European Muslim communities and their relationship with others. Drawing extensively on case studies based on anthropological research in four European countries (Britain, France, Germany and Italy), the paper first examines the problematic character of the category ‘Muslim’, and identifies ways in which Islam in a European context can be considered transnational. It then explores how the question of living as a Muslim in Europe is being addressed in the context of transnationalism, considers whether there is an emergent ‘European Islam’ or ‘European Muslim’ identity, and ends with consideration of the problems and prospects for Islam in European public spheres."

Using unique survey data collected in Mexico through the Mexican Migration Project, I develop and test a new decision-making model of unauthorized labor migration. The new model considers the economic motivations of prospective migrants, as well as their beliefs, attitudes, and social norms regarding U.S. immigration law and legal authorities. My findings show that perceptions of certainty of apprehension and severity of punishment are not significant determinants of the intent to migrate illegally; however, perceptions of availability of Mexican jobs and the dangers of border crossing are significant determinants of these intentions. In addition, individuals’ general legal attitudes, morality about violating U.S. immigration law, views about the legitimacy of U.S. authority, and norms about border crossing are significant determinants of the intent to migrate illegally. Perceptions of procedural justice are significantly related to beliefs in the legitimacy of U.S. authority, suggesting that, all else being equal, procedural fairness may produce greater deference to U.S. immigration law. Together, the results show that the decision to migrate illegally cannot be fully understood without considering an individual’s underlying values and norms."

The childhood census records used in this study classify African Americans as either black or mulatto, allowing for a unique investigation of color stratification in adult life. Consistent with previous research, findings point to the importance of phenotypic characteristics in influencing the life chances of African Americans. Subjects identified as mulatto enjoyed modestly higher adult socioeconomic status compared with subjects identified as black. While the mulatto advantage attenuates slightly once origin characteristics are considered, multivariate results indicate that differences in social origins are responsible for only 10 to 20 percent of the color gap in adult attainment. Findings suggest that color bias (colorism) rather than family background may be responsible for the bulk of color differences in the socioeconomic status of African American men."

But as Richard Alba and Victor Nee show in the first systematic treatment of assimilation since the mid-1960s, it continues to shape the immigrant experience, even though the geography of immigration has shifted from Europe to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Institutional changes, from civil rights legislation to immigration law, have provided a more favorable environment for nonwhite immigrants and their children than in the past. Assimilation is still driven, in claim, by the decisions of immigrants and the second generation to improve their social and material circumstances in America. But they also show that immigrants, historically and today, have profoundly changed our mainstream society and culture in the process of becoming Americans. Surveying a variety of domains--language, socioeconomic attachments, residential patterns, and intermarriage--they demonstrate the continuing importance of assimilation in American life. And they predict that it will blur the boundaries among the major, racially defined populations, as nonwhites and Hispanics are increasingly incorporated into the mainstream.

Conclusion: Remaking the Mainstream Notes Index Reviews of this book: Sociologists Alba and Nee provide a superb, comprehensive analysis of theory, data, and history to revise past and contemporary understandings of immigration and assimilation in the U.S. Their goal is to respond to skeptics' pessimism about new immigrants' assimilability, question misconception about the assimilation experiences of previous and current immigrant groups, reject normative baggage attached to notions of assimilation, and answer the question, 'What can assimilation look like in such a diverse and ethnically dynamic society?' --S. M. Green, Choice Alba and Nee have written a carefully theorized, thoughtfully argued, and empirically well-grounded book. They demonstrate persuasively that the so-called ""new"" immigration is not terribly different from previous ones, and that most of the descendants of today's Hispanic, Asian, and other newcomers are assimilating in much the same way as the children and grandchildren of the European immigration. Their contribution to our understanding of immigration, ethnicity and race should be read far beyond the worlds of social science scholarship. --Herbert J. Gans, Author of Democracy and the News Assimilation is dead, long live assimilation! Alba and Nee are fully aware of the flaws and biases in the old model of the ""melting pot,"" but they rehabilitate it with elegant theory, persuasive facts, and careful attention to its continued racial and class-based failings. The idea of assimilation may be unfashionable, but it has the singular virtue of fitting the case--for many Americans, at any rate--more than other trendier theories do. Remaking the American Mainstream shows us how, why, and to what end. --Jennifer L. Hochschild, co-Author, The American Dream and the Public Schools Alba and Nee have accomplished a tour de force .

W1983306268,0141-9870,['Dennis H. Wrong'],"Sociological theory originates in the asking of general questions about man and society. The answers lose their meaning if they are elaborated without reference to the questions, as has been the case in much contemporary theory. An example is the Hobbesian question of how men become tractable to social controls. The two-fold answer of contemporary theory is that man internalizes social norms and seeks a favorable self-image by conforming to the expectations of others. Such a model of man denies the very possibility of his being anything but a thoroughly socialized being and thus denies the reality of the Hobbesian question. The Freudian view of man, on the other hand, which sociologists have misrepresented, sees man as a social though never a fully socialized creature. Sociologists need to develop a more complex, dialectical conception of human nature instead of relying on an implicit conception that is tailor-made for special sociological problems."

W2113963260,0038-0210,['Craig Calhoun'],"Neither nationalism nor ethnicity is vanishing as part of an obsolete traditional order. Both are part of a modern set of categorical identities invoked by elites and other participants in political and social struggles. These categorical identities also shape everyday life, offering both tools for grasping pre-existing homogeneity and difference and for constructing specific versions of such identities. While it is impossible to dissociate nationalism entirely from ethnicity, it is equally impossible to explain it simply as a continuation of ethnicity or a simple reflection of common history or language. Numerous dimensions of modern social and cultural change, notably state building (along with war and colonialism), individualism, and the integration of large-scale webs of indirect relationships also serve to make both nationalism and ethnicity salient. Nationalism, in particular, remains the pre-eminent rhetoric for attempts to demarcate political communities, claim rights of self-determination and legitimate role by reference to “the people” of a country. Ethnic solidarities and identities are claimed most often where groups do not seek “national” autonomy but rather a recognition internal to or cross-cutting national or state boundaries. The possibility of a closer link to nationalism is seldom altogether absent from such ethnic claims, however, and the two sorts of categorical identities are often invoked in similar ways."

We use it to analyze the determinants of suburban versus central-city residence for 11 racial/ethnic groups. The analysis reveals that family status, socioeconomic, and assimilation variables influence the suburbanization process rather consistently. We take this finding as evidence in favor of the assimilation model. These effects display group variations, however, in a manner predicted by the stratification model. There are also suburbanization differences among metropolitan areas, particularly related to the relative economic status of cities and their suburbs, and between the northeast/north central regions and the south/west. Finally, we conclude that suburbanization is variable across the groups in a way that is not captured by broad categories such as “Asian” or “Hispanic.”"

Paschel'],"After decades of denying racism and underplaying cultural diversity, Latin American states began adopting transformative ethno-racial legislation in the late 1980s. In addition to symbolic recognition of indigenous peoples and black populations, governments in the region created a more pluralistic model of citizenship and made significant reforms in the areas of land, health, education, and development policy. This book explores this shift from color blindness to ethno-racial legislation in two of the most important cases in the region: Colombia and Brazil. Drawing on archival and ethnographic research, the book shows how, over a short period, black movements and their claims went from being marginalized to become institutionalized into the law, state bureaucracies, and mainstream politics. The strategic actions of a small group of black activists—working in the context of domestic unrest and the international community's growing interest in ethno-racial issues—successfully brought about change. The book also examines the consequences of these reforms, including the institutionalization of certain ideas of blackness, the reconfiguration of black movement organizations, and the unmaking of black rights in the face of reactionary movements. This book offers important insights into the changing landscape of race and Latin American politics and provokes readers to adopt a more transnational and flexible understanding of social movements."

The partial character of semicolonialism—as incomplete colonialism—poses the question of what difference it made that throughout the modern period China never in fact became a subject nation, but retained sovereignty over nearly all of its territory and was recognized as a sovereign nation by international law. The writings of twentieth-century Chinese nationalists and a recent profusion of theorizing about colonialism and “colonial modernity” in China, by emphasizing colonialism (Barlow 1997), have perhaps obscured rather than clarified the answer to this question. Moreover, semicolonialism in China, as a gradual accretion of phenomena associated with imperialism, varied substantially over time. Its significance for understanding nineteenth-century China, when the foreign presence within China was still quite limited, remains unclear. Several decades of research on imperialism in Shanghai have produced much debate, but no clear mapping of “where, when, how and to what effect did which extraneous forces impinge” on Chinese life (Osterhammel 1986, 295)."

The exercise is less explanatory in any complete sense than illustrative of the approach.

This paper will argue that this conclusion is premature, as the studies in question have not, in fact, investigated Brazilian categories. What they have done is elicit sorting tasks on the basis of appearances, but the cognitive models of respondents have not been investigated in order to determine what are the boundaries of their concepts. Sorting based on appearances is not sufficient to infer the boundaries of concepts whenever appearance is not a defining criterion for the concepts in question, as the case appears to be for racial and ethnic categories. Following a critique of the methods used, I review a terminological and theoretical confusion concerning the use of the terms 'emic' and 'etic' in anthropology that appears directly responsible for the failure so far to choose methods appropriate to parsing the conceptual domain of 'race' in Brazil."

The result increased the appeal of Indian ethnicity for many individuals, and no doubt contributed to the resurgence of Indian self-identification.

At the center of the relationship between economic liberalization and immigration is the paradox of increasing capital mobility and attempts at controlling more tightly the movement of immigrant workers. Although immigration from Mexico has remained flat over the past ten years, the Mexican population in the United States has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the unanticipated effects of harsh immigration policies since 1986. Prior to that date, Mexicans engaged in cyclical movements, but as security measures became harsher, especially in the 9/11 period, more immigrants and their families settled in the United States hoping to avert the dangers of exit and reentry.

The reformulation also stresses that the main objects of competition in recent ethnic movements have not been individual goods like jobs, but larger collective goods. As amended, the model is compatible with the internal colonial and the split labor market models, as well as with the so-called contact hypothesis.

Structurally adaptive consequences adhere to the maximization of noise and ambiguity as well as to the maximization of shared cognitive order."

This article presents such data from a multiethnic area in Mongolia that found ethnic actors to be heavily primordialist, and uses these data to stimulate a more cogent model of ethnicity that puts the intuitions of both primordialists and circumstantialists on a more secure foundation. Although many points made by the circumstantialists can be accommodated in this framework, the model argues that ethnic cognition is at core primordialist, and ethnic actors' instrumental considerations - and by implication their behaviours - are conditioned and constrained by this primordialist core. The implications of this model of ethnicity for ethnic processes are examined, and data from other parts of the world are revisited for their relevance to its claims."

A comparison of the two disciplines was made, based on the use of interpersonal metadiscourse through `hedges', `emphatics' and `attitude markers'. The analysis showed that the SS writers employed interpersonal metadiscourse more frequently than the NS writers. One-to-one comparison further showed that they varied significantly in their use of hedges and attitude markers but there was little difference in their use of emphatics. However, the use of hedges and emphatics was significantly different within each discipline.

Results show that respondents who have been incarcerated are more likely to identify and be seen as black, and less likely to identify and be seen as white, regardless of how they were perceived or identifed previously.

W2339022613,1572-1906,"['Filiz Garip', 'Asad L. Asad']","Scholars have long noted how migration streams, once initiated, obtain a self-feeding character. Studies have connected this phenomenon, called the cumulative causation of migration, to expanding social networks that link migrants in destination to individuals in origin. While extant research has established a positive association between individuals’ ties to prior migrants and their migration propensities, seldom have researchers interrogated how multiple social mechanisms—as well as exposure to common environmental factors—might account for these interdependencies. This article uses a mixed-methods strategy to identify the social mechanisms underlying the network effects in Mexico–U.S. migration. Three types of social mechanisms are identified, which all lead to network effects: (a) social facilitation, which is at work when network peers such as family or community members provide useful information or help that reduces the costs or increases the benefits of migration; (b) normative influence, which operates when network peers offer social rewards or impose sanctions to encourage or discourage migration; and (c) network externalities, which are at work when prior migrants generate a pool of common resources that increase the value or reduce the costs of migration for potential migrants. The authors first use large-sample survey data from the Mexican Migration Project to establish the presence of network effects and then rely on 138 in-depth interviews with migrants and their family members in Mexico to identify the social mechanisms underlying these network effects. The authors thus provide a deeper understanding of migration as a social process, which they argue is crucial for anticipating and responding to future flows."

While these studies acknowledge that rites of passage occur within particular physical spaces in which material objects are present, the importance of such objects has received little attention. I explore one particular role transition—moving away to college—and illustrate that objects play a central role in how students construct their identities. Students at “Midwestern” University make strategic choices about which objects to leave at home as anchors of prior identities and which ones to bring to school as markers of new identities. Moreover, I suggest that the meanings of these two categories of objects differ by gender. I argue that this case opens up the possibility that objects play a much more central part in role transitions than social scientists have acknowledged. This study also challenges existing assumptions about different processes of identity formation. Therefore, it engenders the need for additional research about how people reinterpret objects during role transitions, and about the different meanings that objects may have for the constructions of masculinity and femininity."

In this study, individuals’ perceptions that they have been the targets of skin-color discrimination are examined. Using 2010 AmericasBarometer data from six nations, a multifaceted account of the possible bases of perceived discrimination is devised and tested. Three classes of predictors are considered: (1) variables related to a person’s skin color, race, and ethnicity; (2) extraneous demographic and psychological factors; and (3) aspects of the individual’s regional social and political context. Results reveal that both skin color and racial and ethnic self-categorization strongly correspond with perceived discrimination, with additional, more modest, effects identified for socioeconomic status (wealth), personality (agreeableness), and the composition of a person’s regional context."

There are three perspectives on the validity of distinguishing “new” and “old” minorities and they emphasize economics, race relations, or politics. Each perspective is supported when Indochinese refugees' relations with other ethnic minorities, whites, and the state are analyzed separately.

The sentence is substantively informative because it conveys a key quantity of interest in terms the reader wants to know. At the same time, the sentence indicates how uncertain the researcher is about the estimated quantity of interest.

In contrast, symbolic attitudes (liberal or conservative ideology, party identification, and racial prejudice) had major effects. Nor did self-interest play much of a role in creating “issue publics” that were particularly attentive to, informed about, or constrained in their attitudes about these specific policy issues. Conditions that might facilitate more self-interested political attitudes, specifically having privatistic (rather than public-regarding) personal values, perceiving the policy area as a major national problem, being high in political sophistication, perceiving the government as responsive, or having a sense of political efficacy, were also explored, but had no effect. The possibility that some long-term self-interest might be reflected in either group membership or in symbolic attitudes themselves is examined.

Marketing professionals’ interpretations of the black consumer’s distinctiveness are used to map the twin processes of internal and external definitions of collective identity for African-Americans. The interviews suggest that marketing professionals (1) actively shape the meanings of the category of ‘the black consumer’ for the public at large; (2) promote powerful normative models of collective identity that equate social membership with conspicuous consumption; (3) believe that African-Americans use consumption to defy racism and share collective identities most valued in American society (e.g. middle-class membership); and (4) simultaneously enact a positive vision of their cultural distinctiveness.

Intellectuals as diverse as Andres Molina Enriquez and Jose Vasconcelos denounced the sterile aping of European doctrines which had characterized the Liberal Reforma of the 1850s, in favour of measures which were based on colonial precedent. In fixing upon mestizaje as the historical mainspring of Mexican nationality, both men echoed Justo Sierra, high priest of Liberal patriotism in the Porfirian era, who had declared that 'the mestizo family ... has constituted the dynamic element in our history'.1 That both Social Darwinism and Romantic Idealism were invoked to justify these claims demonstrates how powerful was the nationalist impulse in Mexico during the first decades of this century. It fell to Manuel Gamio (1883-1960) to apply the principles of Boasian anthropology to further the same cause, albeit, in this case, by insisting on the enduring contribution of Indian civilisation to Mexico's development. As the title of his book, Forjando Patria (1916), clearly attested, Gamio welcomed the Revolution for its destruction of obstacles to the creation of 'the future nationality. ?.. the future Mexican patria'. Although he did not participate in the revolutionary struggle, he praised Pablo Gonzalez, Venustiano Carranza's lacklustre general, as 'an intuitive national? ist', and later characterised Carranza himself as 'a man of many faults, but withal a true progressive and a man of the people', clear evidence that he favoured the victory of the constitutionalist coalition over the popular forces led by Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa.2 In 1935 he asserted that his public goal had always been to promote 'a true, integral nationalism', thus avoiding the contemporary extremes of fascism and communism.3 To assess the significance of Gamio's contribution to the Mexican political and cultural tradition, it should be recalled that although Fray Servando Teresa de Mier and Carlos Maria de Bustamante, the chief ideologues of the 1810 Insurgency, had invoked the grandeur of Anahuac as the chief glory of their Creole patria and defined the Mexican people as a nation which had struggled for three centuries to regain its freedom, a thesis enshrined in the Act of Independence of 1821, by contrast most early nineteenth-century Mexican Liberals dismissed the Aztecs as mere barbarians and viewed contemporary Indians as a hindrance to their country's modernisation.4 In adopting this approach, they could cite Alexander von Humboldt who, in his study of Indian monuments and codices, expounded the neo-classical"

While most studies of sexual identity focus exclusively on sexual orientation as the foundation for identity construction, I demonstrate that contemporary sexual identities are formed along six hierarchically arranged dimensions represented as continuums. These dimensions include (1) quantity of sex, (2) timing of sex, (3) level of perceived enjoyment, (4) degree of consent, (5) orientation, and (6) social value of agents. Along these dimensions, the social marking process is used to construct discrete identities at each extreme. Social marking is a rigid, asymmetrical classification process that accents one side of a contrast as unnatural, thereby tacitly naturalizing the unmarked side. Mental coloring intensifies the rigid contrast by figuratively painting all members of the marked category under a single stereotypical image. I introduce two ideal-typical classification conventions for assigning marked identities: the mental one-drop ruleand the mental entire-ocean rule.These conventions maintain the rigidity of the marking process by preventing identity categories from overlapping. I conclude that the cognitive sociological processes outlined in this article are generalizable to the broader study of identity constructions. Ultimately the social marking of identity legitimates unequal treatment of marked categories by creating the illusion that they are less natural than the unmarked."

This question is particularly significant because virtually every authoritarian regime hopes to change the population's opinions and values through social, educational, political, and economic reforms that will minimize support for the regime's opponents. Yet electoral choices can have remarkable continuity, even though party labels, leaders, and specific programs may change. For instance, even after four decades of Franco's authoritarian regime in Spain, the first parliamentary elections revealed what Juan Linz noted as the impressive continuities in the areas of strength of parties and between certain of the newly created [parties] and those of the past.' This conclusion is warranted by the high correlations between the 1936 and 1977 votes for the Communist Party (.68) and the Socialist Workers' Party (.54), as well as between the Confederation of Autonomous Spanish Rights in 1936 and the Union of the Democratic Center (.46) and Popular Action (.35) in 1977.2 From the presidential election of 1925 to the breakdown of democracy in 1973 the Chilean electorate showed a remarkably consistent division around a right, a center, and a left, each of which obtained (exceptions aside) between about a quarter and two-fifths of the total vote. The military regime of General Augusto Pinochet made a concerted attempt to change the attitudes of Chileans to minimize support for parties of the left. To this end it undertook a series of modernizations which emphasized the strengthening of private initiative and the role of markets in the economy and society while decreasing the size and functions of the state. It also subjected parties to new strictures, proscribed the advocacy of class struggle, and radically altered the electoral system. However, there was little chance the Chilean authoritarian regime would succeed in radically altering the nation's political alignments any more than other such regimes facing well-established party systems. The long electoral history of Chile had created strong political memories and identities and links between parties and segments of organized society. Significant continuities in electoral choices have indeed manifested themselves in Chile since its transition to democracy. They can be seen in a comparison of the 1992 election with past elections and in correlations of the votes cast in 1988, 1989, and 1992 with those of 1969, 1970, and 1973.

Using the 5% Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample 1990 file, we examine the home languages of second- and third-generation children and compare the degree of their language shift against that among the descendants of European immigrants, as evidenced in the 1940 and 1970 censuses. Overall, the rates of speaking only English for a number of contemporary groups suggest that Anglicization is occurring at roughly the same pace for Asians as it did for Europeans, but is slower among the descendants of Spanish speakers. Multivariate models for three critical groups—Chinese, Cubans, and Mexicans—indicate that the home languages of third-generation children are most affected by factors, such as intermarriage, that determine the languages spoken by adults and by the communal context."

Penner']","The authors link the literature on racial fluidity and inequality in the United States and offer new evidence of the reciprocal relationship between the two processes. Using two decades of longitudinal data from a national survey, they demonstrate that not only does an individual’s race change over time, it changes in response to myriad changes in social position, and the patterns are similar for both self-identification and classification by others. These findings suggest that, in the contemporary United States, microlevel racial fluidity serves to reinforce existing disparities by redefining successful or high-status people as white (or not black) and unsuccessful or low-status people as black (or not white). Thus, racial differences are both an input and an output in stratification processes; this relationship has implications for theorizing and measuring race in research, as well as for crafting policies that attempt to address racialized inequality."
W44464140,0037-7732,"['Thomas M. Wilson', 'Hastings Donnan']","This book offers fresh insights into the complex and various ways in which international frontiers influence cultural identities. The ten anthropological case studies collected here describe specific international borders in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, and bring out the importance of boundary politics, and the diverse forms that it may take. The frontier itself may be of great symbolic importance; in other cases the symbolism lies rather in the disappearance of the traditional border. A frontier may be above all a barrier against immigration, or the front line between hostile armies. It may reinforce distinctive identities on each side of it, or the frontier may be disputed because it cuts across national identities. Drawing on anthropological perspectives, the book explores how cultural landscapes intersect with political boundaries, and ways in which state power informs cultural identity."
W2120520825,0010-4175,['Herbert C. Kelman'],"The interactions between identity groups engaged in a protracted conflict lack the conditions postulated by Gordon Allport in The Nature of Prejudice (1954) as necessary if contact is to reduce intergroup prejudice. The article examines the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from this perspective. After summarizing the history of the conflict, it proposes that a long-term resolution of the conflict requires development of a transcendent identity for the two peoples that does not threaten the particularistic identity of each. The nature of the conflict, however, impedes the development of a transcendent identity by creating a state of negative interdependence between the two identities such that asserting one group's identity requires negating the identity of the other. The resulting threat to each group's identity is further exacerbated by the fact that each side perceives the other as a source of some of its own negative identity elements, especially a view of the self as victim and as victimizer. The article concludes with a discussion of ways of over-coming the negative interdependence of the two identities by drawing on some of the positive elements in the relationship, most notably the positive interdependence between the two groups that exists in reality. Problem-solving workshops represent one setting for equal-status interactions that provide the parties the opportunity to “negotiate” their identities and to find ways of accommodating the identity of the other in their own identity."
W2078722835,0020-8833,['Sharon M. Lee'],"Abstract This article examines racial classifications on United States population census schedules between 1890 and 1990 to provide insights on the changing meanings of race in US society. The analysis uses a sociology of knowledge perspective which assumes that race is an ideological concept that can be interpreted most productively by relating its definition and measurement to the larger social and political context. Four themes are identified and discussed: (i) the historical and continuing importance of skin colour, usually dichotomized into white and non‐white, in defining race and counting racial groups; (ii) a belief in ‘pure’ races that is reflected in a preoccupation with categorizing people into a single or ‘pure’ race; (iii) the role of census categories in creating pan‐ethnic racial groups; and, (iv) the confusing of race and ethnicity in census racial classifications. Each theme demonstrates the potential or actual role of official statistics, exemplified by census racial data, in reflecting and guiding changes to the meaning and social perceptions of race. A detailed examination of racial classifications from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses shows that the influence of political interests on racial statistics is particularly important. The article concludes with a discussion of whether official statistical recorders such as population censuses should categorize and measure race, given the political motivations and non‐scientific character of the classifications used."

Many, particularly anthropologists and linguists, anticipate the demise of the majority of Indigenous languages within this century and have called on the need to arrest the loss of languages. Opinions vary concerning the loss of language; some regard it as a hopeless cause, and others see language revitalization as a major responsibility of linguistics and kindred disciplines. To that end, this review explores efforts in language revitalization and documentation and the engagement with Indigenous peoples. It remains unclear why some attempts at language revitalization succeed, whereas others fail. What is clear is that the process is profoundly political."

W62258295,1948-5565,['Lita Furby'],"Most work on the psychology of justice has failed to state explicitly, let alone justify, its underlying definitional assumptions. This failure has inevitably led to conceptual confusion and to inconsistent use of terminology. The definition adopted in this chapter is that justice involves an evaluative judgment about the moral rightness of a person’s fate: that is, a person’s treatment by others (including nonhuman forces) is judged to be just if it corresponds to some standard or criterion of what is morally right.1 Some psychologists have implicitly assumed more restricted definitions of justice, such as the objective and impartial treatment of persons (i. e., fairness). This definition limits the concept of justice to an evaluative judgment of how people should be treated only when there are competing claims and conflicts of interest. In my view, such a restriction places undue emphasis on scarcity and competition in human interaction, an emphasis that is pervasive but also distorting (see Gross & Averill, 1983). I am assuming that justice refers not only to fair treatment but also to respect for the needs and rights inherent in human nature—an assumption that is shared by some (e. g., Adler, 1981) but not by all (see Buchanan & Mathieu, Chapter 2, this volume). Justice is usually said to exist when people receive what they are due, and they are due not only fairness but treatment consistent with their natural rights as human beings. When discussing other authors who have defined justice more narrowly, I have placed single quotation marks around the word justice in order to distinguish their usage from my own."

The focus is whether the Church differentiates its use of cultural arguments in accordance with its insider/outsider institutional status, or the contested nature of the abortion policy-making environment. The prevalence of women-oriented themes is also explored. I find that in each country the Church draws more heavily on cultural than on doctrinal sources of legitimation, and exhibits a strong similarity in the sorts of cultural arguments used. There is a significant difference in the patterned appeal to national identity in the U.S. and Poland, and its absence in England and Ireland."

Sawyer']","The intensification of ethno-racial protest in Latin America has led to the adoption of targeted legislation for Black and indigenous populations, signaling a new moment in race politics in this region. Existing literature has failed to account for this shift either because it held that race was not salient in Latin America, or it presumed that racial hierarchy existed, but that the obstacles to Black mobilization were insurmountable. We argue the literature must contend with this new reality of what we call “Black politics” in Latin America. While impediments to race-based mobilization, which are rooted in color-blind nationalism, the fluidity of identity, and poverty, do in fact exist, we argue that Black social movement organizations have overcome some of these obstacles. We examine the development of Black social movements in a number of Latin American countries, focusing specifically on the political contexts in which they emerge, their articulation, the nature of their claims, and measures of their effectiveness. We argue that despite many obstacles to Black mobilization in Latin America, Black organizations are beginning to constitute viable political interest groups. In all of the cases that we analyze, we find that Black social movement organizations have been effective not only in bringing about symbolic and material policy changes, but have also shaken national ideologies of mestizaje and racial democracy. We also contend that while Black social movements in Latin America are very much rooted in domestic politics, transnational networks and international institutions are central to the articulation and effectiveness of these movements."

From a research perspective, one way to nuance this position is by focusing on groups of ‘invisible’ Muslims. Another path, which I pursue here, is to situate the activism of Muslims in the historical fabric of the neighbourhood(s) in which they live, in this case the Copenhagen neighbourhood of Nørrebro. Given that Muslims and others use Nørrebro as they do, this neighbourhood has become a prominent example of the effects of multiculturalism in larger national debates, a situation affecting research engagement with the community. In the last part of my article I describe my dialogical approaches for engaging with the community, thus situating the article within wider discussions of research self-reflexivity and critical ethnography (Clifford and Marcus 1986; Madison 2005)."

W4299946577,0070-3370,"['Jim Sidanius', 'Felicia Pratto']","This volume focuses on two questions: why do people from one social group oppress and discriminate against people from other groups? and why is this oppression so mind numbingly difficult to eliminate? The answers to these questions are framed using the conceptual framework of social dominance theory. Social dominance theory argues that the major forms of intergroup conflict, such as racism, classism and patriarchy, are all basically derived from the basic human predisposition to form and maintain hierarchical and group-based systems of social organization. In essence, social dominance theory presumes that, beneath major and sometimes profound difference between different human societies, there is also a basic grammar of social power shared by all societies in common. We use social dominance theory in an attempt to identify the elements of this grammar and to understand how these elements interact and reinforce each other to produce and maintain group-based social hierarchy."
W4243562145,0161-5440,['Theodore M. Porter'],"This investigation of the overwhelming appeal of quantification in the modern world discusses the development of cultural meanings of objectivity over two centuries. How are we to account for the current prestige and power of quantitative methods? The usual answer is that quantification is seen as desirable in social and economic investigation as a result of its successes in the study of nature. Theodore Porter is not content with this. Why should the kind of success achieved in the study of stars, molecules, or cells be an attractive model for research on human societies? he asks. And, indeed, how should we understand the pervasiveness of quantification in the sciences of nature? In his view, we should look in the reverse direction: comprehending the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research will teach us something new about its role in psychology, physics, and medicine. Drawing on a wide range of examples from the laboratory and from the worlds of accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and civil engineering, Porter shows that it is ""exactly wrong"" to interpret the drive for quantitative rigor as inherent somehow in the activity of science except where political and social pressures force compromise. Instead, quantification grows from attempts to develop a strategy of impersonality in response to pressures from outside. Objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts, quantification becoming most important where elites are weak, where private negotiation is suspect, and where trust is in short supply."

W2318220880,0031-8906,['Edna Bonacich'],"A distinguishing feature of the black position in advanced capitalism lies in relatively high unemployment and underemployment, a phenomenon that emerged in the 1930s and became firmly entrenched in the mid-1950s. To explain this we examined the black/white split labor market between World War I and the New Deal, showing how blacks were used to undermine white workers and their unions. The conflict was resolved with New Deal Labor legislation, protecting the unions and outlawing undercutting. This permitted a coalition to emerge between black and white workers. But in the long run the rising cost of labor drove capital to seek cheaper labor overseas, to make use of internal pockets of unprotected labor or to automate. All three processes hurt black industrial workers disproportionately, leaving a group of hardcore unemployed in the ghettos."
W2102734499,0011-5266,['Juliet Hooker'],"This article analyses the causes of the disparity in collective rights gained by indigenous and Afro-Latin groups in recent rounds of multicultural citizenship reform in Latin America. Instead of attributing the greater success of indians in winning collective rights to differences in population size, higher levels of indigenous group identity or higher levels of organisation of the indigenous movement, it is argued that the main cause of the disparity is the fact that collective rights are adjudicated on the basis of possessing a distinct group identity defined in cultural or ethnic terms. Indians are generally better positioned than most Afro-Latinos to claim ethnic group identities separate from the national culture and have therefore been more successful in winning collective rights. It is suggested that one of the potentially negative consequences of basing group rights on the assertion of cultural difference is that it might lead indigenous groups and Afro-Latinos to privilege issues of cultural recognition over questions of racial discrimination as bases for political mobilisation in the era of multicultural politics."
W2136285763,0092-055X,['Mala Htun'],"By analyzing the Brazilian government's surprise endorsement of affir- mative action in 2001, this article explores how the state constructs race in society and how ideas drive policy change. After decades defending the myth of democracy, the state admitted to racism and endorsed an extreme form of affirma- tive action—quotas—for Afro-Brazilians in government service and higher educa- tion. Based on fieldwork conducted in 2002, this article explains the recent policy turnaround as a dialectic between social mobilization and presidential initiative framed within unfolding international events. The presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso nurtured a transformation in political action on race at the same time that the president himself initiated major shifts in official discourse; later, preparations for the World Conference on Racism, held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, pro- voked national soul-searching on racial inequalities. The conference itself provided an occasion, and a moment of reckoning, for Brazil to jettison past policies and embrace a new approach. I conclude that ideas emerging from social networks, made salient by presidential interest, and legitimized by international agreements may account for discursive policy change, but that implementation of affirmative action will require attention to material interests and electoral incentives."

It focuses on the underlying structural conditions that facilitate the expansion of ethnic boundaries or the construction of a pan-national identity, and explores how organizing along an ethnic boundary affects collective efforts at the panethnic level. Two processes could be occurring: (1) Competition with other ethnic or racial groups could lead groups with different national origins to engage in collective action based on a pan-national boundary, or (2) occupational segregation could foster pan-national interests and networks that lead groups to participate in pan-national collective action. Using a new longitudinal data set of collective action events involving Asian Americans, the analyses indicate that the segregation of Asians as a group raises the frequency of pan-national collective action, while the segregation among Asian subgroups depresses the rate of pan-Asian collective action. The results also show that intragroup competition discourages pan-Asian collective action, and organizing along ethnic lines generally facilitates it. Overall, these findings are consistent with the cultural division of labor theory, which suggests that segregation processes influence panethnic collective action due to intragroup interaction, common economic interests, and membership in a community of fate."

Cornell shows how, in the early days of colonization, Indians were able to maintain their nationhood by playing off the competing European powers; and how the American Revolution and westward expansion eventually caused Native Americans to lose their land, social cohesion, and economic independence. The final part of the book recounts the slow, steady reemergence of American Indian political power and identity, evidenced by militant political activism in the 1960s and early 1970s. By paying particular attention to the evolution of Indian groups as collective actors and to changes over time in Indian political opportunities and their capacities to act on those opportunities, Cornell traces the Indian path from power to powerlessness and back to power again."

However, the majority of work to date has narrowly defined the population of multiracial individuals as the “biracial” children of single-race parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 5% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part-American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups."

Data are from two sets of ethnographic interviews in southeastern Puerto Rico, including 23 free listing interviews and 42 structured interviews using Harris's standardized facial portraits. Results indicate a small core of salient emic categories with well-defined semantic structure and high interinformant agreement, reflecting shared cultural understandings of color.

We find that a forced binary question format results in a whiter and more racially unequal picture of Brazil through the movement of many higher income mixed-race respondents into the white category. We also find that regardless of question format, racial inequality in income accounts for relatively little of Brazil's overall income inequality. We discuss implications for public policy debates in Brazil, and for the broader scientific and political challenges of ethnic and racial data collection and analysis."
W2094854118,0046-2772,['C. Matthew Snipp'],"Abstract The number of inter‐racial marriages has increased sharply in the last two decades. There are a number of factors that might account for this development ‐ for example, immigration, changing norms, and marriage market composition ‐ but one indisputable outcome has been a rise in the number of persons with multiracial backgrounds. This article argues that multiracial persons have a number of options about how they might identify their ancestry, and this is causing fluidity and instability in racial divisions that were once considered fixed and immutable. While this might be seen as a recent development, American Indians historically have had high rates of intermarriage with other racial groups.

The phrase may be used to indicate a point of view concerning the desirability or undesirability of racial crossing, wherever this has occurred, and between whatever peoples it has taken place. The question as to the character of the hypothesis itself, however, is somewhat difficult to answer, for there is not one position but two taken on the matter. Since each of these two positions, which are diametrically opposed, claim support from the findings of studies made on human and animal populations, it is important that they be differentiated at the outset of our discussion. The first of them holds that racial crossing is pernicious in its effects; the second maintains that inbreeding is inadvisable, since new strains must be introduced into a population if fertile, virile offspring are to be assured. Any consideration of these two mulatto hypotheses, then, must range beyond the confines which would be set if only Negro-white crossing were studied, while such a consideration must similarly include not only a discussion of the results of crossing on the intellectual capabilities of mixed-bloods, but also on their physical potency and social efficiency. The first of the two positions has perhaps been best phrased by Gates, who is one of its strongest proponents: Crossing in mankind may be regarded as of three types: (1) Between individuals of the same race. (2) Between different, but nearly related, races; e.g., between the Nordic, Mediterranean and Alpine or East Baltic races, or between different African tribes, or Chinese and Japanese stocks. Such intercrossing goes on continually without causing comment or raising serious problems. (3) Between more distantly related races. Here we might again distinguish (a) crosses between two primitive or two advanced races from (b) crosses between an advanced and a primitive stock. It is only the last type which raises serious difficulties, and is probably undesirable from every point of view. Of course there is no sharp line between the most advanced and the most primitive races, but all intergrades occur. Nevertheless, the distinction I have drawn is certainly an important one.'"

Three characteristics of a field—the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks—determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries.

W4240214998,0094-0496,['Mara Loveman'],"The era of official color-blindness in Latin America has come to an end. For the first time in decades, nearly every state in Latin America now asks their citizens to identify their race or ethnicity on the national census. Most observers highlight the historic novelty of these reforms, but National Colors shows that official racial classification of citizens has a long history in Latin America. Through an analysis of the politics and practice of official ethnoracial classification in the censuses of 19 Latin American states across nearly two centuries, this book explains why most Latin American states classified their citizens by race on early national censuses, why they stopped the practice of official racial classification around midcentury, and why they reintroduced ethnoracial classification on national censuses at the dawn of the 21st century. Beyond domestic political struggles, the analysis reveals that the ways that Latin American states classified their populations from the mid-nineteenth century onward responded to changes in international criteria for how to construct a modern nation and promote national “development.” As prevailing international understandings of what made a political and cultural community a modern nation changed, so too did the ways that Latin American census officials depicted diversity within national populations. The way census officials described populations in official statistics, in turn, shaped how policymakers “saw” national populations and informed their prescriptions for national development–with consequences that still reverberate in contemporary political struggles for recognition, rights, and redress for ethnoracially marginalized populations in today’s Latin America."
W1989233977,0003-1224,['Michael Hout'],"The effect of socioeconomic background on occupational attainment is well established. But the effect of status does not account for all of the association between occupational origins and destinations. The amount of autonomy accorded to workers and the degree of specialization in the training required of them are also important for mobility. Men whose fathers were entrepreneurs or were employed in other positions that require little supervision are more likely than men whose fathers were closely supervised to enter occupations that offer at least some degree of on-the-job autonomy. Autonomy and training are especially important for immobility. Men whose fathers were autonomous or specially trained are more likely than other men to be immobile. A model incorporating the effects of socioeconomic status, on-the-job autonomy, and specialized training is fitted to the 1962 and 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation data. The models fits the data well with few parameters. Subpopulations defined by race, age, and education are also analyzed. The analysis provides new insight into the weakening of the association between origins and destinations between 1962 and 1973, the convergence of black and white mobility patterns, and the role of education as an intervening variable in the mobility process."

It shows how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century concepts of race attempted to explain human difference in terms of race as a permanent type and how these were followed by social scientific conceptions of race as a form of status. In a new concluding chapter, 'Race as social construct', Michael Banton makes the case for a historically sensitive social scientific understanding of racial and ethnic groupings which operates within a more general theory of collective action and is, therefore, able to replace racial explanations as effectively as they have been replaced in biological science. This book is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand contemporary debates about racial and ethnic conflict."
W2008495319,0045-8511,['Hilary N. Weaver'],"Indigenous identity is a truly complex and somewhat controversial topic. There is little agreement on precisely what constitutes an indigenous identity, how to measure it, and who truly has it. Indeed, there is not even a consensus on appropriate terms. Are we talking about Indians, American Indians, Natives, Native Americans, indigenous people, or First Nations people? Are we talking about Sioux or Lakota? Navajo or Dine? Chippewa, Ojibway, or Anishnabe? Once we get that sorted out, are we talking about race, ethnicity, cultural identity, tribal identity, acculturation, enculturation, bicultural identity, multicultural identity, or some other form of identity? The topic of indigenous identity opens a Pandora's box of possibilities, and to try to address them all would mean doing justice to none. This article provides background information on three facets of identity-self-identification, community identification, and external identification-followed by a brief overview of measurement issues and my reflections on how internalized oppression /colonization is related to identity. The terms Native and indigenous are used interchangeably to refer to the descendants of the original inhabitants of North America. These are not, per se, the right terms or the only terms that could have been used. They reflect my preferences. Cultural identity, as reflected in the values, beliefs, and worldviews of indigenous people, is the focus of the article. Those who belong to the same culture share a broadly similar conceptual map and way of interpreting language.' People can identify themselves in many ways other than by their cultures.2 In fact, identity may actually be a composite of many things such as race, class, education, region, religion, and gender.3 The influence of these aspects of identity on who someone is as an indigenous person is likely to change over time. Identities are always fragmented, multiply constructed, and intersected in a constantly changing, sometimes conflicting array.4 Although in reality the various facets of identity are inextricably linked, for the purposes of this essay I will focus on culture as a facet of identity."

Hale'],"Although scholars often treat “ethnicity” as one of the most important phenomena in politics, nothing close to a consensus has emerged about not only what its effects are but also what it is. Theorists typically divide this debate into two camps, usually dubbed “primordialism” and “constructivism,” but these categories are unhelpful and actually obscure some of the most important questions. This study recasts the debate by providing a micro-level explanation for why and how people tend to think and act in terms of macro-level identity categories in the first place. Drawing heavily on recent psychological research, this approach reveals why ethnicity is special and why it is ascribed importance by researchers in fields as diverse as sociology, anthropology, and political science. As it turns out, neither constructivism nor primordialism is fully accurate, and theorists are advised to think in terms that are more consistent with psychological research."

These analyses relied heavily on data collected between 1950 and 1980. In particular, many scholars have utilized the National Survey of Black Americans (1979–1980). This leaves the question of whether or not the effect of skin tone on stratification outcomes remains decades later. Newly available data from the National Survey of American Life (2001–2003) are used to examine this question. I find that skin tone is significantly associated with black Americans’ educational attainment, household income, occupational status, and even the skin tone and educational attainment of their spouses. Consequently, this study demonstrates that skin tone stratification among black Americans persists into the 21st century. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of ethnoracial inequality in the United States and beyond."

Modern political and economic affairs are distinguished by the increasing frequency, scale, and importance of indirect social relationships. The reproduction of embodied but social sensibilities, habituses, is altered as social life comes more and more to be coordinated through indirect relationships. Recognizing the role of indirect relations and imagined communities provides a way to understand the increasing split between everyday life and large-scale systemic integration, thus potentially informing and improving Jurgen Habermas's account of social versus system integration. Perhaps the most important transformation of everyday life in the modern era has been the sharpening and deepening of a split between the world of direct interpersonal relationships and the mode of organization and integration of large-scale social systems."

Models for central-city and suburban public schools permit estimation of the segregative effects that one system exerts on an adjacent system. In 1968, higher black proportions in cities enhanced segregation in suburbs, and higher proportions in suburbs promoted segregation in cities. Although city and suburban school segregation declined during the 1970s, segregation between cities and suburbs increased. Higher black proportions in cities put segregative pressure on their suburbs. The historic link between residential and public-school segregation was broken in southern but not in northern cities nor the suburbs of either region. Private-school utilization by whites had segregative effects on southern city systems, but not elsewhere. The boundaries between city and suburban school systems appear to foster racial inequalities within those systems as class theories predict."

We argue that big firms actively recruited female lawyers during a period when women were needed to fill roles of cultivating and serving increasing numbers of institutional or corporate clients. Yet despite women's contribution of legal talent to the development of clientele, a glass ceiling has restricted their opportunities to advance in law firm hierarchies. We examine two approaches to gender inequities in law firm hierarchy: disparity as economic efficiency and disparity as structural discrimination. Both approaches neglect aspects of social relations within law firms as well as social resources lawyers bring to their work. We therefore introduce a social capital perspective to unpack how human capital is enhanced and how exclusionary practices are reinforced in law firms. Using a longitudinal study of male and female lawyers conducted from 1990 to 1996, we specify several different forms of social capital. The findings from our study reveal that female lawyers participate fully in the accumulation of social capital in law firms, through service to valued institutional clientele and high billings, yet their efforts result in reduced probabilities of partnership"

Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically impossible—an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels. In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level.

To make a refined assessment of the magnitude of gender differences in mathematics performance, we performed a meta-analysis of 100 studies. They yielded 254 independent effect sizes, representing the testing of 3,175,188 Ss. Averaged over all effect sizes based on samples of the general population, d was -0.05, indicating that females outperformed males by only a negligible amount. For computation, d was -0.14 (the negative value indicating superior performance by females). For understanding of mathematical concepts, d was -0.03; for complex problem solving, d was 0.08. An examination of age trends indicated that girls showed a slight superiority in computation in elementary school and middle school. There were no gender differences in problem solving in elementary or middle school; differences favoring men emerged in high school (d = 0.29) and in college (d = 0.32). Gender differences were smallest and actually favored females in samples of the general population, grew larger with increasingly selective samples, and were largest for highly selected samples and samples of highly precocious persons. The magnitude of the gender difference has declined over the years; for studies published in 1973 or earlier d was 0.31, whereas it was 0.14 for studies published in 1974 or later. We conclude that gender differences in mathematics performance are small. Nonetheless, the lower performance of women in problem solving that is evident in high school requires attention."

W2011654696,0094-582X,['Greg Grandin'],"Over the latter half of the twentieth century, the Guatemalan state slaughtered more than two hundred thousand of its citizens. In the wake of this violence, a vibrant pan-Mayan movement has emerged, one that is challenging Ladino (non-indigenous) notions of citizenship and national identity. In The Blood of Guatemala Greg Grandin locates the origins of this ethnic resurgence within the social processes of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century state formation rather than in the ruins of the national project of recent decades.

Focusing on Mayan elites in the community of Quetzaltenango, Grandin shows how their efforts to maintain authority over the indigenous population and secure political power in relation to non-Indians played a crucial role in the formation of the Guatemalan nation. To explore the close connection between nationalism, state power, ethnic identity, and political violence, Grandin draws on sources as diverse as photographs, public rituals, oral testimony, literature, and a collection of previously untapped documents written during the nineteenth century. He explains how the cultural anxiety brought about by Guatemala’s transition to coffee capitalism during this period led Mayan patriarchs to develop understandings of race and nation that were contrary to Ladino notions of assimilation and progress. This alternative national vision, however, could not take hold in a country plagued by class and ethnic divisions. In the years prior to the 1954 coup, class conflict became impossible to contain as the elites violently opposed land claims made by indigenous peasants.

This “history of power” reconsiders the way scholars understand the history of Guatemala and will be relevant to those studying nation building and indigenous communities across Latin America."

W2129003919,0037-7732,"['Jennifer Lee', 'Frank D. Bean']","Over the past four decades, immigration has increased the racial and ethnic diversity in the United States. Once a mainly biracial society with a large white majority and relatively small black minority—and an impenetrable color line dividing these groups—the United States is now a society composed of multiple racial and ethnic groups. Along with increased immigration are rises in the rates of racial/ethnic intermarriage, which in turn have led to a sizeable and growing multiracial population. Currently, 1 in 40 persons identifies himself or herself as multiracial, and this figure could soar to 1 in 5 by the year 2050. Increased racial and ethnic diversity brought about by the new immigration, rising intermarriage, and patterns of multiracial identification may be moving the nation far beyond the traditional and relatively persistent black/white color line. In this chapter, we review the extant theories and recent findings concerning immigration, intermarriage, and multiracial identification, and consider the implications for America's changing color lines. In particular, we assess whether racial boundaries are fading for all groups or whether America's newcomers are simply crossing over the color line rather than helping to eradicate it."
W2026696249,0022-0027,['Matthijs Kalmijn'],"I assess whether intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics has increased over the course of the twentieth century and, if it has, whether the declining salience of religious boundaries has been accompanied by a rising importance of educational boundaries in spouse selection. By analyzing a set of national surveys that were conducted between 1955 and 1989 and using a research design that separates the effects of period and duration of marriage, I examine changes over a longer period of time than any previous study has done. Multivariate loglinear analyses show that intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics has increased dramatically since the 1920s, while intermarriage between different educational groups has decreased. Currently, the social boundaries that separate educational groups seem to be stronger than the boundaries that separate Protestants and Catholics. In addition, there is some evidence that interfaith marriages have become increasingly homogamous with respect to education, suggesting that education has replaced religion as afactor in spouse selection."

Whereas genetic data were first used to prove the validity of race, since the early 1970s they have been used to illustrate the invalidity of biological races. Indeed, race does not account for human genetic variation, which is continuous, complexly structured, constantly changing, and predominantly within ""races."" Despite the disproof of race-as-biology, genetic variation continues to be used to explain racial differences. Such explanations require the acceptance of 2 disproved assumptions: that genetic variation explains variation in disease and that genetic variation explains racial variation in disease. While the former is a form of geneticization, the notion that genes are the primary determinants of biology and behavior, the latter represents a form of racialization, an exaggeration of the salience of race. Using race as a proxy for genetic differences limits understandings of the complex interactions among political-economic processes, lived experiences, and human biologies.

Migration and diaspora insufficiently take into account the possibility of quite distinct self‐understandings about boundaries and legitimacy on the part of both ‘host’ countries and ‘immigrant’ populations.

Whether based on gender, age, or how people enter, there is considerable heterogeneity in the unauthorized migrant population.

A method of estimating ethnic reidentification in the USSR is described and evaluated. The expected number of survivors to the second census date for each age cohort of a given ethnic group is compared to the reported number of cohort members at the second census date to determine the net number who have changed their ethnic self-identification between censuses. The method establishes relative differences in the propensity to reidentify ethnically among 26 Soviet ethnic groups. Many small ethnic groups in European Russia are found to have very high estimated rates of ethnic russification; non-Russian Slavs—Ukrainians and Belorussians—are found to have fairly low estimated rates of ethnic russification. The implications of the Russian gain in population through ethnic reidentification also are assessed."

Throughout the monograph, we will concentrate on three distinct challenges which we consider relevant for Mexican language policy. The first area of interest is the challenge of the multilingual situation where there is conflict between Spanish and the indigenous languages, most of which are in danger of shift. This situation has many consequences both for education and for linguistic human rights. The second challenge that is discussed is that of foreign language teaching, which is a growing need in the Mexican education system, just as it is for any economically developing nation. In particular, English is in high demand at all levels of education; in turn, this development creates new demands for teaching staff. The third challenge dealt with is Spanish as the language of 90% of all Mexican citizens. While we recognise the role of Spanish as constituting a threat to the indigenous languages, it also plays an important role as a symbol of national identity and has developed a diversity of local varieties. Overall, Mexico has the greatest number of speakers of Spanish in the world and it is a major source of such cultural commodities as films, books, music and theatre. In addition, Spanish itself poses serious educational challenges, with regard to literacy."

Analyses of census and Current Population Survey data show that educational homogamy decreased from 1940 to 1960 but increased from 1960 to 2003. From 1960 to the early 1970s, increases in educational homogamy were generated by decreasing intermarriage among groups of relatively well-educated persons. College graduates, in particular; were increasingly likely to marry each other rather than those with less education. Beginning in the early 1970s, however; continued increases in the odds of educational homogamy were generated by decreases in intermarriage at both ends of the education distribution. Most striking is the decline in the odds that those with very low levels of education marry up. Intermarriage between college graduates and those with ""some college"" continued to decline but at a more gradual pace. As intermarriage declined at the extremes of the education distribution, intermarriage among those in the middle portion of the distribution increased. These trends, which are similar for a broad cross section of married couples and for newlyweds, are consistent with a growing social divide between those with very low levels of education and those with more education in the United States."

There are three major findings. First, the enrollment profiles of the poor differ across countries but fall into distinctive regional patterns: in some regions the poor reach nearly universal enrollment in first grade, but then drop out in large numbers leading to low attainment (typical of South America), while in other regions the poor never enroll in school (typical of South Asia and Western/Central Africa). Second, there are enormous differences across countries in the “wealth gap,” the difference in enrollment and educational attainment of the rich and poor. While in some countries the difference in the median years of school completed of the rich and poor is only a year or two, in other countries the wealth gap in attainment is 9 or 10 years. Third, the attainment profiles can be used as diagnostic tools to suggest issues in the educational system, such as the extent to which low attainment is attributable to physical unavailability of schools."

Using census data and log-linear and log-multiplicative methods, I compare the patterns of educational assortative mating in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, and explore the association between marital sorting and earnings inequality across countries. The analysis finds substantial variation in the strength of specific barriers to educational intermarriage between countries, and a close association between these barriers and the earnings gaps across educational categories within countries. This finding suggests an isomorphism between assortative mating and economic inequality. Furthermore, educational marital sorting is remarkably symmetric across gender in spite of the different resources that men and women bring to the union. This study highlights the limitations of using single aggregate measures of spousal educational resemblance (such as the correlation coefficient between spouses’ schooling) to capture variation in assortative mating and its relationship with socioeconomic inequality."

This article focuses on the recent Mexican controversy about the legal status of the indigenous population and the nature of nationalism, which is linked to recent constitutional amendments and new policy strategies. Changes in legislation and policy are examined in the context of a widespread economic and political crisis of the populist regime after 1982, which radically affected the previous indigenist discourse; but they are also seen as having been motivated by Indian demands and mobilisations against the official vision of citizenship as a function of cultural homogeneity and mestizaje. The article analyses the implications of the new constitutional amendments and the heated debates that they have provoked among different political actors, including indigenous organisations. In particular, it examines two areas of disagreement. The first concerns the multiple meanings of multiculturalism – as a threat of fragmentation and fundamentalism, a new form of state control or a strategy for indigenous national participation and empowerment. The second concerns the definition and levels of implementation of indigenous political autonomy. Negotiation over such disagreements, leading to inclusive citizenship, constitute a great challenge for ethnic intellectuals and theoreticians of Mexican nationalism."

Behrman, Alejandro Gaviria, and Miguel Székely Inequality is widely regarded as one of the main problems facing Latin American countries both historically and today. The chasm that separates the haves and the have-nots is considered not only a source of social turmoil and violence (political and otherwise), but also a drag on economic growth and even a source of macroeconomic instability. Not surprisingly, social commentators from different ideological perspectives have repeatedly argued that a more equal distribution of income and assets ought to be a major, if not the main, priority of public policy in the region.1 To better understand the causes of high inequality in the region and to inform policy choices that might affect the problem, it would be useful to know whether inequality is mainly driven by the absence of opportunities for large segments of the population stemming from individual family backgrounds or by differences in individual characteristics that are separate from family backgrounds. Two different societies with the same level of inequality may have very different levels of social welfare depending on whether family characteristics play a substantial role in determining individuals' fates in life. If they do, then inequality is largely the reflection of the absence of opportunities for those with poor family backgrounds, society is likely to be viewed as less fair than if family background were not so important, and policies aimed at reducing inequality have ample justification. [End Page 1] As important as the previous issues are, very little is known about the extent to which family background affects socioeconomic outcomes in Latin America, and hence little is known about the extent of inequality of opportunity either in the region as a whole or in particular countries. Public opinion surveys show that most of the region's inhabitants believe that opportunities are very limited for large sectors of the population.2 These opinions have not been confirmed by systematic quantitative analysis, however, because of the absence of data sets containing information on various generations of adults in the same family, without which it is very difficult to gauge the effect of family background on socioeconomic outcomes. We follow two different strategies to circumvent the lack of longitudinal data sets that hampers previous attempts to study intergenerational mobility in Latin America. First, we rely on household surveys that include retrospective questions about parental socioeconomic characteristics. After a thorough search, we were able to gather information on parental characteristics for adults in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, which, to the best of our knowledge, are the only countries in the region that have collected this type of information. These four countries account for 65 percent of the population of the region. We examine the intergenerational transmissions of schooling and occupational status for these countries and draw some comparisons with the United States. Our results reveal that intergenerational mobility is much higher in the United States than in these Latin American countries and that there are sizable differences in mobility among them. These differences are systematically associated with mean schooling attainment both over time and across countries. However, changes in schooling attainment do not appear to be correlated with changes in mobility. This type of analysis is inherently historical in that it focuses on the connection between family background and schooling achievements for past generations. Our second strategy uses a database constructed on the basis of 112 household surveys for nineteen Latin American and Caribbean countries and the United States to study these connections for more recent generations. We focus on teenagers coresiding with their parents, [End Page 2] and we examine the effects of family background on their relative schooling success. We document the existence of large differences in current mobility within Latin America and between Latin America and the United States. We also show that mobility tends to be higher in countries where teens have more years of schooling and in countries that spend more money on education, which confirms our earlier results. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief overview of the literature on cross-national comparisons of intergenerational mobility.

Neil Harvey combines ten years of field work in Chiapas with extensive historical and political research to provide a comprehensive history of conflict in this region and a nuanced analysis of this rural uprising against federal bureaucracy and landed elites.

Beginning with an exploration of the history of ethnic and class conflict in Chiapas since the Conquest, Harvey moves specifically to trace the development of peasant and indigenous organizations in Chiapas since the early 1970s. He compares the struggles for agrarian rights of three grassroots movements facing hostility from both local elites and federal bureaucrats. His examination of the complexities of political change in Chiapas includes the impact of neoliberal economic policies, the origins of the Zapatista army of National Liberation (EZLN), and the political impact of the rebellion itself. Engaging with current theoretical debates on the role and significance of social movements in Mexico and Latin America, Harvey focuses on the primacy of political struggle and on the importance of these movements in the construction and meaning of citizenship. While suggesting that the Zapatista revolution has heightened awareness among the people of Chiapas of such democratic issues as ethnicity, gender, and land distribution, he concludes with an analysis of the obstacles to peace in the region today.

The topics are wide-ranging, comparing how individuals use the cultural tools at their disposal to answer questions such as: are races equal? What constitutes sexual harassment?

He has emerged with an unusually comprehensive and convincingly realistic picture of blue-collar life in America. Throughout the book, Halle illustrates his analysis with excerpts of workers' views on everything from strikes, consciousness, politics, job security, and toxic chemicals to marriage, betting on horses, God, home-ownership, drinking, adultery, the Super Bowl, and life after death. Halle challenges the stereotypes of the blue-collar mentality and argues that to understand American consciousness we must shift our focus from the working class to be the working man."

Rather than seeing it as having a 'face', she considers power as a complex network of social boundaries - norms, identities, institutions - which define both the field of action and the individual's freedom within it, for the 'powerful' and 'powerless' alike. Hayward suggests that the critical analysis of power relations should focus on the ways these relationships affect people's capacities to help shape the institutions and practices which govern their lives. Using a detailed comparative analysis of the relationships within two ethnically diverse educational settings - one in a low-income, predominantly African-American, urban school, the other in an affluent, predominantly white, suburban school - this book develops a compelling account of the concept of power in terms of networks of practices and relations."

Participation in solidary groups has consequences for the social bases of politics, and the political salience of such groups is affected by social institutions that are independent of occupational structure. The first such institution is direct rule. Whereas indirect rule tends to promote class politics, direct rule favors cultural politics. Rapid expansion of direct rule since the 1960s has muted class politics and increased cultural politics. This relationship is not deterministic, however; other institutions can mitigate the effects of direct rule on the social bases of politics."

They insist on the right to live according to traditional usos y costumbres, to self-government in accord with local practices and customs. They demand recognition as collective units, and have fought for the inclusion of the term pueblo—peoples—in the constitution. Their claims for collective rights include bilingual education, the right to local and regional autonomy, and to communal land as the basis of the cultural reproduction of the group. These demands are seen by many as a threat to both emergent and established democracies. Demands for collective rights are in tension with the commitments of liberal democracies to individual rights. Moreover, demands for autonomy and self-determination are perceived to be threatening to the national identity of the state. If democracy rests in part on an ideal of “the people” as a cohesive group that has the capacity to deliberate together to achieve consensus, then the demands of some of the people for autonomy, and for recognition of their difference, threaten to undermine the fabric of the national culture. At an extreme, the SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 70, No. 2 (Summer 2003) The Politics of Indigenous Identity: Neoliberalism, Cultural Rights, and the Mexican Zapatistas COURTNEY JUNG very borders of the state are at stake, as groups make demands for self-determination and even independence. By and large, theorists of democracy and multiculturalism have failed to develop an account of the contemporary salience of such demands for cultural recognition, focusing instead on theories of human identity to explain the politics of indigenous rights claims. They argue that demands for cultural recognition are an expression of the individual’s attachment to his or her cultural group. As Will Kymlicka says, the bond between individuals and their cultural groups is simply “a fact . . . whose origins lie deep in the human condition, tied up with the way humans as cultural creatures need to make sense of their world, and that a full explanation would involve aspects of psychology, sociology, linguistics, the philosophy of mind, and even neurology” (Kymlicka, 1995: 90). Charles Taylor argues that human identity is constituted by cultural group membership, and an individual’s sense of self worth is thus deeply tied to the value that others attach to his or her cultural group. As a result of this “new understanding of the human social condition ,” cultural recognition can be construed as a necessary component of individual recognition, and misrecognition can reasonably be considered a form of oppression (Taylor, 1994: 2526 ). If cultural group attachment is a feature of the human social condition, liberal theory had better deal with cultural group rights if it is to be relevant. Against this backdrop, the contemporary emergence of cultural claims for recognition is seen as a result of the homogenizing threats of modernity, and the frequency with which previously insular cultural units come into contact with one another and with the penetrating reach of the liberal state and neoliberal economic policies . Demands for cultural recognition seem to stem from a protective instinct in defense of the familiar and the local. Taylor states, for example, that “in pre-modern times people didn’t speak of ‘identity’ and ‘recognition’—not because people didn’t have (what we call) identities, or because these didn’t depend on recognition, but because these were then too unproblematic to be thematized 434 SOCIAL RESEARCH as such” (1994: 35). It is only in the present era that the possibility of misrecognition has generated the conditions of oppression. In a sympathetic vein, Seyla Benhabib argues that “the continuing subjection of tradition to critique and revision in a disenchanted universe make it difficult for individuals to develop a coherent sense of self and community under conditions of modernity” (1992: 81). The demand for cultural recognition springs from a crisis of identity as human beings are buffeted by misrecognition and incoherence in a (modern or postmodern?) world. Deborah Yashar strikes a similar chord in her analysis of the recent emergence of a Latin American indigenous rights movement as a defensive reaction against external threat to the community . Yashar argues that corporatism, coupled with the failure of the state to..."

W2090966482,0002-7162,['Filiz Garip'],"Abstract To evaluate the distributional impact of remittances in origin communities, prior research studied how migrants’ selectivity by wealth varies with migration prevalence in the community or prior migration experience of the individual. This study considers both patterns; it examines selectivity separately in low- and high-prevalence communities and for first-time and repeat migrants. Based on data from 18,042 household heads in 119 Mexican communities from the Mexican Migration Project, the analyses show that (1) first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities come from poor households, whereas repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households; and (2) higher amounts of remittances reach wealthy households. These results suggest that repeat migration and remittances may be mechanisms for wealth accumulation in the study communities. Descriptive analyses associate these mechanisms with increasing wealth disparities between households with and without migrants, especially in high-prevalence communities. The study, similar to prior findings, shows the importance of repeat migration trips, which, given sustained remittances, may amplify the wealth gap between migrants and nonmigrants in migrant-sending communities. The study also qualifies prior findings by differentiating between low- and high-prevalence communities and observing a growing wealth gap only in the latter."
W144089400,1071-4421,['Jennifer L. Hochschild'],"Jennifer Hochschild When Do People Not Protest Unfairness? The Case of Skin Color Discrimination It was a color thing and a class thing. And for generations of black people, color and class have been inexorably tied together. —Lawrence Graham (2000) Well-to-do, fair-skinned kids in the neighborhood weren’t allowed to play with him and they regularly taunted him about his color, Jones says. . . . “That’s been a dominant force in my life,”he says. “Having lived through those expe­ riences gave me the desire to fight for the disadvantaged.” —Robinson-English (2005) That’s bullshit research. —Comment at a conference to coauthor of paper on skin color and political attitudes, 2004 ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE develop and act on a sense of unfairness is to clarify the conditions in which they do not do so."" The conditions may not be mirror images, of course—there may be an intermediate zone of confusion, or the two social research Vol 73 : No 2 : Summer 2006 473 situations may not be exactly symmetrical—but they are surely related. In this article I consider why African Americans tend not to protest or perhaps even to recognize discriminatory treatment by skin color, even or especially when they are deeply sensitive to discrimination by race. I will do so, in part, by briefly considering a parallel issue: why poor Americans tend not to protest economic inequalities, even when they recognize them to be excessive or even unfair.1 Part ofwhat makes this subject so fascinating is that it is not clear that, from a normative or political standpoint, blacks should protest skin color discrimination or poor whites should protest unfair economic inequalities. From their own vantage points, members of these groups may gain more by not protesting than they would gain by protesting. I find that conclusion hard to take, but I consider it after laying out the initial empirical propositions. The article concludes with an argument about why African Americans, and other Americans, should neverthe­ less attend more than they do to skin tone differentiation. ""IT’S A COLOR THING AND A CLASS THING” Colorism The analysis starts from the presumably uncontroversial presumption that race matters. More precisely, African Americans can be expected to resemble each other in perceptions of discrimination and under­ standings of unfairness more than they will resemble members of any other group.2Less well known, however, is that how people behave and are treated is affected not only by the nominal category of race, but also by the ordinal category o f multiple shades of skin tone. This is the phenomenon of “colorism”—“the tendency to perceive or behave toward members of a racial category based on the lightness or dark­ ness of their skin tone” (Maddox and Gray, 2002: 250). As with racism, a pejorative connotation is built into the word. Also like racism, it can be defined either unidirectionally (only those with power and status— that is, light-skinned people—can exhibit colorism) or multidirectionally (people of one skin shade can denigrate or subordinate people of another, in any possible direction).3 Colorism can occur within one’s 474 social research own community, or across racial and ethnic groups. In theory, it can hold for Anglos, Asians, or any other “racial”group. Skin Color Hierarchy in History Within communities of color, hierarchy based on skin tone is long­ standing and widely, if often silently, acknowledged. Lawrence Graham, for example, fills in the epigram above by writing, Iknew some [otherblack people] who not only had complex­ ions ten shades lighter than that brown paper bag, and hair as straight as any ruler, but also had multiple generations of “good looks,” wealth, and accomplishment. . . . It was a color thing and a class thing. And for generations of black people, color and class have been inexorably tied together (Graham, 2000). Our more systematic historical research demonstrates that the importance of skin color on life chances dates back at least to the nine­ teenth century.4 Vesla Weaver’s analyses show that lighter-skinned black soldiers in the Union Army of the Civil War were, compared with darker-skinned soldiers, more likely to be skilled..."
W1972089347,0002-7162,['Beverly Nagel Lauwagie'],"This paper explores recent developments in the ecological model of ethnic boundary maintenance typified by Barth and Hannan, focusing on applications of a formal model of competition drawn from population ecology. The latter model can be used to analyze adaptive strategies groups resort to in competitive situations, such as occur during modernization. At one extreme, groups may maximize their relative population size and use political means to claim and hold a share of a society's resources. This strategy is well known, and several theorists emphasize the advantages of large relative size in ethnic group relations. This paper focuses on the strategy at the other end of the continuum. Bioecologists use the term ""r-strategists"" to refer to especies which maximize their ability to discover ephemeral resources, exploit them quickly, and then disperse in search of new resources. Gypsies and Travellers in modern states are discussed as examples of ethnic r-strategists. These groups are seen to maximize their ability to discover and exploit resources which are irregular in space and time and subject to numerous and varying local constraints through their nomadism and flexible organization. The analysis illustrates the environmental conditions under which r-selection occurs among ethnic groups and identifies some of the characteristics of these groups which may contribute to their success."

American expansionists justified the new role of the United States by emphasizing the responsibility the country had undertaken in elevating less-fortunate peoples to govern themselves. The expansionists were convinced of the superior capacity for self-government on the part of the white, Anglo-Saxon people of the United States. They held dark-skinned people in low regard, for the latter had not yet acquired the requisite characteristics of self-control and political maturity upon which the capacity for self-government was based. The burden of carrying forward the world's work, as Theodore Roosevelt put it, consisted in large measure of supervising the native peoples in these insular areas eventually to direct their own affairs through limited participation in government, and through a program of organized instruction in the schools. The inhabitants, after an unspecified period of tutelage, would unlearn archaic or decadent Latin ways and substitute in their stead the way of life of their American mentors."

W42978862,1537-5927,['Mary C. Waters'],"In this perceptive and revealing study, Mary Waters explores the 'reinvention' of ethnicity in the lives of the grandchildren and great grandchildren of European immigrants, asking how their ethnic heritage is lived, maintained, and celebrated. Through in-depth interviews with sixty third and fourth generation white ethnics in suburban California and Pennsylvania, the author discovers a surprisingly resilient sense of ethnicity among people who could reasonably label themselves simply 'American'. Mary Waters' research brings to light a fascinating history of American immigration, revealing aspects of a shared culture and ideology and the unique ways in which ethnic identities fulfill very American needs. Describing the 'symbolic ethnicity' of later generation white ethnics as a quintessential American phenomenon, she argues that ethnicity has retained its importance in our lives precisely because it allows people to reconcile the contradictory American values of choice, individuality, and community. In addition to her exploration of the symbolic ethnicity of later generation middle-class whites, Mary Waters addresses its cost to society, contrasting it with the optionless ethnicity of non-white Americans. Her conclusions in Ethnic Options constitute an invaluable contribution to our understanding of contemporary American life."

Tamir explores a set of problems that philosophers have been notably reluctant to take on, and leaves us all in her debt.""--Michael Walzer In this provocative work, Yael Tamir urges liberals not to surrender the concept of nationalism to conservative, chauvinist, or racist ideologies. In her view, liberalism, with its respect for personal autonomy, reflection, and choice, and nationalism, with its emphasis on belonging, loyalty, and solidarity are not irreconcilable. Here she offers a new theory, ""liberal nationalism,"" which allows each set of values to accommodate the other. Tamir sees nationalism as an affirmation of communal and cultural memberships and as a quest for recognition and self-respect. Persuasively she argues that national groups can enjoy these benefits through political arrangements other than the nation-state. While acknowledging that nationalism places members of national minorities at a disadvantage, the author offers guidelines for alleviating the problems involved using examples from currents conflicts in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. Liberal Nationalism is an impressive attempt to tie together a wide range of issues often kept apart: personal autonomy, cultural membership, political obligations, particularity versus impartiality in moral duties, and global justice. Drawing on material from disparate fields--including political philosophy, ethics, law, and sociology--Tamir brings out important and previously unnoticed interconnections between them, offering a new perspective on the influence of nationalism on modern political philosophy."

W2003084972,0049-089X,['Richard Stahler-Sholk'],"The Zapatista autonomy movement in Chiapas, Mexico, is a significant example of rising social-movement resistance to neoliberalism. The neoliberal project in Latin America since the 1980s has led to a retrenchment of the state, opening new space for social movements to contest power from below. In Mexico, the weakening of corporatist and clientelist mechanisms once controlled by the party-state allowed groups like the Zapatistas to assert rights based on both collective (ethnic) identity and Mexican national citizenship. An examination of the Zapatista autonomy movement since 1994 suggests several dilemmas: (1) A territorially based model of autonomy as administrative decentralization would not fundamentally alter existing political hierarchies or the role of the state as broker for global capital. (2) Autonomy conceived as mere disengagement would leave autonomous communities cut off from resources and unprotected from the forces of the global market. (3) Autonomy defined as simply cultural pluralism falls into the neoliberal “multiculturalism trap” of atomizing communities, substituting formal “equality” for the power to establish collective identities and demand substantive rights. The Zapatistas have maneuvered around counterinsurgency and co-optation through a flexible, community-based model of autonomy, shifting in 2003 to a model of regional Juntas de Buen Gobierno with rotating representatives to integrate the resistance.

Beginning in the 1970s, survey data indicated that the average migrant was a young, unmarried man who was poor, undereducated, and in search of better employment opportunities. This is the general view that most Americans still hold of immigrants from Mexico. This book argues that not only does this view of Mexican migrants reinforce the stereotype of their undesirability, but it also fails to capture the true diversity of migrants from Mexico and their evolving migration patterns over time. Using survey data from over 145,000 Mexicans and in-depth interviews with nearly 140 Mexicans, the book reveals a more accurate picture of Mexico–U.S migration. In the last fifty years there have been four primary waves: a male-dominated migration from rural areas in the 1960s and 1970s, a second migration of young men from socioeconomically more well-off families during the 1980s, a migration of women joining spouses already in the United States in the late 1980s and 1990s, and a generation of more educated, urban migrants in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For each of these four stages, the book examines the changing variety of reasons for why people migrate and migrants’ perceptions of their opportunities in Mexico and the United States. Looking at Mexico–U.S. migration during the last half century, the book uncovers the vast mechanisms underlying the flow of people moving between nations."

Hirschfeld'],"Race in the Making provides a new understanding of how people conceptualize social categories and shows why this knowledge is so readily recruited to create and maintain systems of unequal power.Hirschfeld argues that knowledge of race is not derived from observations of physical difference nor does it develop in the same way as knowledge of other social categories. Instead, his central claim is that racial thinking is the product of a special-purpose cognitive competence for understanding and representing human kinds. The book also challenges the conventional wisdom that race is purely a social construction by demonstrating that a common set of abstract principles underlies all systems of racial thinking, whatever other historical and cultural specificities may be associated with them.Starting from the commonplace observation that race is a category of both power and the mind, Race in the Making directly tackles this issue. Through a sustained exploration of continuity and change in the child's notion of race and across historical variations in the race concept, Hirschfeld shows that a singular commonsense theory about human kinds constrains the way racial thinking changes, whether in historical time or during childhood.After surveying the literature on the development of a cultural psychology of race, Hirschfeld presents original studies that examine children's (and occasionally adults') representations of race. He sketches how a jointly cultural and psychological approach to race might proceed, showing how this approach yields new insights into the emergence and elaboration of racial thinking."

In understanding these processes and conditions which produce norms it may be useful to begin by inquiring into the ways in which norms provide adaptive solutions or functional advantages that are superior to other forms of social control. Such a functional approach has been suggested by Thibaut and Kelley (1959, pp. 130-42) in discussing the consequences of substituting normative control for control by interpersonal power. For example, in the A-B (dyadic) relationship, suppose A is in the act of exercising power over B. The substitution of normative control for the use of raw power may be advantageous to A as it enables him to regularize and stabilize his control over B. At the same time, the substitution reduces A's costs of surveillance and eliminates the ostentation of his power usage. The advantages to B of this substitution are less apparent but"

The ultimate test, however, and the justification for undertaking any sociological examination of cultural objects, is the usefulness of the resulting account in confirming or rejecting ideas about the social conditions surrounding their production. The important question in judging the appropriateness of examining individual objects is therefore not whether sociologists (as opposed, for example, to art historians) ought to concern themselves with such analysis; it is whether such analyses increase the ability of objects to serve as evidence in investigations of interesting social phenomena. My goal is not therefore to supplant generic analysis with a focus on individual objects: it is as possible to fetishize the study of the object as it is to ignore its potential. In fact, it is most useful to see the two approaches as complementary, making possible fuller analyses than each can enable separately. We would do well to take more seriously the benefits of locating objects in the contexts in which people deal with them most commonly: as distinct elements in more inclusive fields, in which meaning and appeal are closely tied to difference."

It shows that the central question which has divided theorists of nationalism is the place of the past in the life of modern nations.

In South Africa and the United States, ethnic or regional conflicts among whites were resolved by unifying whites and excluding blacks, while Brazil's longer established national unity required no such legal racial crutch.

Catholic indigenous parishioners empowered by competition demanded the same benefits their Protestant neighbors were receiving: social services, ecclesiastic decentralization, and the practice of religion in their own language. Unable to decentralize ecclesiastic hierarchies, and facing a reputation deficit for having sided with rich and powerful elites for centuries, Catholic clergy stepped into the secular realm and became active promoters of indigenous movements and ethnic identities; they embraced the cause of the Indians as a member retention strategy and not in response to new doctrinal ideas emanating from Vatican II. Drawing on an original data set of indigenous mobilization in Mexico and on life histories and case studies, I provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the causal effect of religious competition on the creation of the social bases for indigenous ethnic mobilization."

Bowen (bio) Much recent discussion of international affairs has been based on the misleading assumption that the world is fraught with primordial ethnic conflict. According to this notion, ethnic groups lie in wait for one another, nourishing age-old hatreds and restrained only by powerful states. Remove the lid, and the cauldron boils over. Analysts who advance this idea differ in their predictions for the future: some see the fragmentation of the world into small tribal groups; others, a face-off among several vast civilizational coalitions. They all share, however, the idea that the world’s current conflicts are fueled by age-old ethnic loyalties and cultural differences. 1 This notion misrepresents the genesis of conflict and ignores the ability of diverse people to coexist. The very phrase “ethnic conflict” misguides us. It has become a shorthand way to speak about any and all violent confrontations between groups of people living in the same country. Some of these conflicts involve ethnic or cultural identity, but most are about getting more power, land, or other resources. They do not result from ethnic diversity; thinking that they do sends us off in pursuit of the wrong policies, tolerating rulers who incite riots and suppress ethnic differences. In speaking about local group conflicts we tend to make three assumptions: first, that ethnic identities are ancient and unchanging; second, that these identities motivate people to persecute and kill; and third, that ethnic diversity itself inevitably leads to violence. All three are mistaken. [End Page 3] Contrary to the first assumption, ethnicity is a product of modern politics. Although people have had identities—deriving from religion, birthplace, language, and so on—for as long as humans have had culture, they have begun to see themselves as members of vast ethnic groups, opposed to other such groups, only during the modern period of colonization and state-building. The view that ethnicity is ancient and unchanging emerges these days in the potent images of the cauldron and the tribe. Out of the violence in Eastern Europe came images of the region as a bubbling cauldron of ethnonationalist sentiments that were sure to boil over unless suppressed by strong states. The cauldron image contrasts with the American “melting pot,” suggesting that Western ethnicities may melt, but Eastern ones must be suppressed by the region’s unlikable, but perhaps necessary, Titos and Stalins. Nowhere does this notion seem more apt than in the former Yugoslavia. Surely the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians are distinct ethnic groups destined to clash throughout history, are they not? Yet it is often forgotten how small the differences are among the currently warring factions in the Balkans. Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians all speak the same language (Italy has greater linguistic diversity) and have lived side by side, most often in peace, for centuries. Although it is common to say that they are separated by religion—Croats being Roman Catholic, Serbs Orthodox Christian, and Bosnians Muslim—in fact each population includes sizeable numbers of the other two religions. The three religions have indeed become symbols of group differences, but religious differences have not, by themselves, caused intergroup conflict. Rising rates of intermarriage (as high as 30 percent in Bosnia) would have led to the gradual blurring of contrasts across these lines. As knowledgeable long-term observers such as Misha Glenny have pointed out, the roots of the current Balkan violence lie not in primordial ethnic and religious differences but rather in modern attempts to rally people around nationalist ideas. “Ethnicity” becomes “nationalism” when it includes aspirations to gain a monopoly of land, resources, and power. But nationalism, too, is a learned and frequently manipulated set of ideas, and not a primordial sentiment. In the nineteenth century, Serb and Croat intellectuals joined other Europeans in championing the rights of peoples to rule themselves in “nation-states”: states to be composed of one nationality. For their part, Serbs drew on memories of short-lived Serb national states to claim their right to expand outward to encompass other peoples, just as other countries in Europe (most [End Page 4] notably France) had done earlier.

Unlike the common treatment of racial identification as a fixed and self-evident determinant of social status or behavior, we treat it as a flexible social outcome. We find that though white identification is largely shaped by skin color, it is also shaped by national context, social status, and age. We discover that white identification is more common among persons of a brown skin color in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica than in the rest of Latin America, where such persons would generally identify as mestizo. This suggests that the whitening ideologies of these four countries have made whiteness a more capacious category. We find that younger Latin Americans are less likely to identify as white compared to their older conationals, suggesting a changing valorization of whiteness. Furthermore, college-educated persons are less likely to identify as white than their lower-educated counterparts, challenging ideas that “money whitens.” Findings for age and education may reflect a recent shift to multiculturalism. In addition, we find that white identification is predicted to change in response to the survey interviewer’s color, suggesting that choices about racial identification are relational. The work of historians has been critical to understanding our findings for the contemporary period, and we suggest ways that sociological work like ours might inform historical work on race and ethnicity."

While other dimensions of stratification such as, for example, gender and age also enjoy political legitimacy, the politics of race/ethnicity has displaced class politics on the American political scene. This hegemony of race/ethnicity in the perception and discussion of most conflict and political struggle is the result of the complex interaction of many factors. Perhaps most important is the heterogeneous origin of the population, whose composition is continuously affected by the changing nature of immigration flows. Demographic factors alone, however, cannot have such powerful political effects; one must take into account the heritage of slavery, the presence of colonized minorities (Native Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Puerto Ricans), and the lasting political effects of McCarthyism, which eradicated the left from American politics and defined class politics as un-American. Equally important are the effects of deindustrialization, economic recession, steadily increasing unemployment, and the erosion of the st-andard of living of the American working class. A key determinant of the salience of race and ethnicity in American politics is the role of the state in legitimating the labeling of people in racial terms, thus creating, despite the heterogeneity of the populations thus labeled, races1 and ethnicities that presumably can be described on the basis of real and identifiable common traits. The current definitions of Asians, blacks, and Hispanics are exceedingly broad,' and they have the objective effect of minoritizing the entire world (Gimenez, 1988). These labels ignore socialclass and national-origin differences among people, thus blurring the differences between U.S. minority groups (populations historically oppressed in the United States) and immigrants.

Organizations in a similar line of work are structured into an organizational field by powerful forces that lead them to become similar. Rather than the causes of rationalization and bureaucratization suggested by Max Weber, including competition and the need for efficiency, institutional similarity is due to the structuration of organizational fields, a process caused largely by the state and the professions, which are the great rationalizers of the late 20th century. In highly structured organizational fields, rational efforts of individuals aggregately lead to structural, cultural, and output homogeneity. Homogenization is best captured by the concept of isomorphism, the process whereby one element in a population resembles others that confront the same environmental conditions. The two types of isomorphism are competitive and institutional. Three processes lead to organizational similarity: (1) coercive isomorphism stemming from political influence and the problem of legitimacy; (2) mimetic isomorphism resulting from uniform responses to uncertainty; and (3) normative isomorphism associated with professionalism. While these isomorphic processes improve organizational transactions, they do not necessarily increase internal efficiency. Twelve hypotheses are offered for further research about which organizational fields will be most homogenous. These hypotheses relate the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalism and structuration on isomorphic change.

Transnational studies, we argue, including the study of transnational migration, is linked to periods of intense globalization such as the turn of the twenty-first century. Yet transnational studies have their own contradictions that may reintroduce methodological nationalism in other guises. In studying migration, the challenge is to avoid both extreme fluidism and the bounds of nationalist thought."

Using a panel of 10 population-specific alleles, we assigned to each person an African ancestry index (AAI). The procedure was able to tell apart, with no overlaps, 20 males from northern Portugal from 20 males from São Tomé Island on the west coast of Africa. We also tested 10 Brazilian Amerindians and observed that their AAI values fell in the same range as the Europeans. Finally, we studied two different Brazilian population samples. The first consisted of 173 individuals from a rural Southeastern community, clinically classified according to their Color (white, black, or intermediate) with a multivariate evaluation based on skin pigmentation in the medial part of the arm, hair color and texture, and the shape of the nose and lips. In contrast to the clear-cut results with the African and European samples, our results showed large variances and extensive overlaps among the three Color categories. We next embarked on a study of 200 unrelated Brazilian white males who originated from cosmopolitan centers of the four major geographic regions of the country. The results showed AAI values intermediate between Europeans and Africans, even in southern Brazil, a region predominantly peopled by European immigrants. Our data suggest that in Brazil, at an individual level, color, as determined by physical evaluation, is a poor predictor of genomic African ancestry, estimated by molecular markers."

In contrast to the traditional emphasis on the transplanted cultural heritage as the principal antecedent and defining characteristic of ethnic groups, we suggest that the development and persistence of ethnicity is dependent upon structural conditions characterizing American cities and position of groups in American social structure. Attention is focused on the question: under what conditions does ethnic culture emerge? Specifically, what social forces promote the crystallization and development of ethnic solidarity and identification? As an emergent phenomenon, ethnicity continues to develop with the changing positions of groups and individuals within society. As society changes, old forms of ethnic culture may die oui but new forms may be generated."

Specifically, they have argued that the public's attitudes, as compared to those of the political elite, show less stability over time and less consistency between issues and are less likely to be based upon an underlying ideological predisposition. These hypotheses have been supported, generally, by computing correlations between attitude questions and comparing them between public and elite samples. The present paper examines all three hypotheses using a structural equation approach. This allows us to: (a) test for a single common underlying ideological construct; (b) separate ideological stability from issuespecific stability; and (c) use unstandardized structural coefficients to make between-sample comparisons. Using panel data from 1972-1974-1976 national surveys, we find that both the highly educated and the uneducated public show evidence of an underlying ideological predisposition, show remarkable stability in their attitudes, and show equal consistency or constraint between different attitude issues."

This article focuses on boundaries within and between groups. It discusses the history, current research, and future challenges of work on this topic. Two of the founding fathers of sociology played central roles in shaping the literature on symbolic boundaries: Emile Durkheim and Max Weber. Their contributions are reviewed before turning to the ‘neo-classical’ writings of Mary Douglas, Norbert Elias, and Thornstein Veblen, which illustrate the lasting influence of Durkheim and Weber on this literature up to the 1960s. The question of how boundaries intersect with the production of inequality has attracted great interest in recent years. In the United States in particular, cultural sociologists have been working to assess some of Pierre Bourdieu's theoretical claims and to use his work as a stepping stone for improving our understanding of the cultural aspects of class, gender, and racial inequality. Other important developments concern the study of identity through boundary work, and research on moral order, community, and symbolic politics. Future challenges include (a) a necessary synthesis of the various strands of work that speak to boundary issues across substantive areas; and (b) a study of the connection between objective and subjective boundaries."

Ferguson (1896) is infamous for its doctrine of “separate but equal,” which gave constitutional legitimacy to Jim Crow segregation laws. What is less-known about the case is that the appellant Homer Plessy was, by all appearances, a white man. In the language of the Court, his “one-eighth African blood” was “not discernible in him.” This article analyzes Plessy as a story of racial “passing.” The existence of growing interracial populations in the nineteenth century created difficulties for legislation designed to enforce the separation of the races. Courts were increasingly called upon to determine the racial identity of particular individuals. Seen as a judicial response to racial ambiguity, Plessy demonstrates the law's role not only in the treatment of racial groups, but also in the construction and maintenance of racial categories."

Few demographers have considered whether such axes of place stratification in a migrant-sending country relate to individuals’ access to economic and social resources in a migrant-receiving country. Taking Mexico-US migration flows as our focus, we examine if having origins in an indigenous place, a primary axis of stratification in Mexico, is associated with migrants’ documentation status when crossing the border, a primary dimension of stratification in the United States. We rely on individual-level data from the Mexican Migration Project merged with municipal-level data from the Mexican Census. Using multilevel models, we find that migrants from communities in indigenous municipalities in Mexico are more likely to migrate undocumented than documented to the United States compared with those from communities in non-indigenous municipalities, net of the economic and social resources identified in prior work as useful for international movement. We discuss why indigenous places — marked by a set of correlated conditions of economic and social disadvantage — disproportionately channel migrants into an undocumented status. This study contributes to understandings of stratification processes in cross-border contexts and has implications for the production of inequality in the United States."

The Peruvian state introduced a weak indigenous electoral quota, and its effects have varied across provinces. This article presents a typology that combines descriptive and substantive dimensions of political representation. Using a subnational comparative method, the four cases studied illustrate distinct dynamics. The article argues that these differing dynamics are explained by a combination of sociostructural variables (i.e., political articulation and cohesion of indigenous organizations as a result of a conflict) and individual variables (i.e., candidates’ political capital). This article demonstrates how, even in an institutionally adverse environment that does not feature ethnic parties, both descriptive and substantive indigenous political representation can be achieved, and that these two dimensions are not necessarily related. The article is based on fieldwork and interviews with key provincial political actors."

W2038631063,0037-7791,['Charles Tilly'],"The word conveniently identifies the process by which a group goes from being a passive collection of individuals to an active participant in public life. Demobilization is the reverse process. Offensive mobilization is, however, often top-down. In the offensive case, a group pools resources in response to opportunities to realize its interests. Preparatory mobilization is no doubt the most top-down of all. In this variety, the group pools resources in anticipation of future opportunities and threats. Governmental repression is uniquely important because governments specialize in the control of mobilization and collective action: police for crowd control, troops to back them, spies and informers for infiltration, licensing to keep potential actors visible and tame. Contention for power links the mobilization model to the polity model. The word socialism itself originally represented the vision of a social order in which producers would control their own fates."

Contrary to Bourdieu's (1984) prediction, musical exclusiveness decreases with education. Also, political tolerance is associated with musical tolerance, even controlling for educational attainment, and racism increases the probability of disliking genres whose fans are disproportionately non-White. Tolerant musical taste, however, is found to have a specific pattern of exclusiveness : Those genres whose fans have the least education-gospel, country, rap, and heavy metal-are also those most likely to be rejected by the musically tolerant. Broad familiarity with music genres is also significantly related to education.

Drawing on extensive participant-observation with a variety of environmentalist groups, Paul Lichterman argues that individualism sometimes enhances public, political commitment and that a shared respect for individual inspiration enables activists with diverse political backgrounds to work together. This personalised culture of commitment has sustained activists working long-term for social change. The book contrasts 'personalised politics' in mainly white environmental groups with a more traditional, community-centred culture of commitment in an African-American group. The untraditional, personalised politics of many recent social movements invites us to rethink common understandings of commitment, community, and individualism in a post-traditional world."

Cesar Ayala analyzes and compares the explosive growth of sugar production in the three nations following the War of 1898--when the U.S. acquired Cuba and Puerto Rico--to show how closely the development of the Spanish Caribbean's modern economic and social class systems is linked to the history of the U.S. sugar industry during its greatest period of expansion and consolidation. Ayala examines patterns of investment and principal groups of investors, interactions between U.S. capitalists and native planters, contrasts between new and old regions of sugar monoculture, the historical formation of the working class on sugar plantations, and patterns of labor migration. In contrast to most studies of the Spanish Caribbean, which focus on only one country, his account places the history of U.S. colonialism in the region, and the history of plantation agriculture across the region, in comparative perspective. |This comparative study of the development of plantation economies in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic in the early 20th century shows how their economic and social class systems were shaped by the explosive growth of American sugar companies."

Usually, American politics is looked upon as relatively consensual and nonideological. Professor Gerring argues, instead, that the major parties have articulated views that were coherent, differentiated, and stable. American party history, and by extension American political history at-large, has been irreducibly ideological. The argument rests on evidence provided by election rhetoric - speeches, party platforms, and other campaign tracts disseminated by party leaders during presidential campaigns. With these texts Professor Gerring traces the values, beliefs, and issue-positions which have defined party life from the 1830s to the 1990s.

In contrast, the authors argue that the change in the institutional form of states is itself a major cause for war. The rise of empires and the global spread of the nation-state are the most important institutional transformations in the modern age. To test this hypothesis, the authors introduce a new data set that records the outbreak of war in fixed geographic territories from 1816 to 2001, independent of the political entity in control of a territory. Analysis of this data set demonstrates that wars are much more likely during and because of these two transformations. For the transformation to the modern nation-state, the authors confirm this hypothesis further with logit regressions that control for variables that have been robustly significant in previous research. The results provide support for the main mechanisms that explain this time dependency. Modern nation-states are ruled in the name of a nationally defined people, in contrast to empires, which govern to spread a faith across the world, to bring civilization to backward people, or to advance the world revolutionary cause. The institution of the nation-state thus introduces incentives for political elites to privilege members of the national majority over ethnic minorities, and for minority elites to mobilize against such political discrimination. The resulting power struggles over the ethno-national character of the state may escalate into civil wars. Interstate wars can result from attempts to protect co-nationals who are politically excluded in neighboring states. The reported research thus provides a corrective to mainstream approaches, which exclude ethnic and nationalist politics as factors that would help understanding the dynamics of war."

The subjective identification with some ethnic groups notably the Irish and Germans exceeds what natural increase would imply while identification with other ethnic groups falls short of what demographic processes would imply. Loglinear models of ethno-religious intermarriage show that religious diversity is an important factor in the diffusion of Irish and German identities while the relative religious homogeneity of the British and Italians limits the diffusion of those identities.

W1979259728,0003-066X,['JoEllen Shively'],"I examine sociological models of how people use and interpret cultural materials. My focus is on how minorities participate in and rework central myths of dominant culture. After viewing a Western film, matched groups of American Indian and Anglo males answered written questionnaires and participated in focus-group interviews. American Indians and Anglos both liked thefilm, but for different reasons. Indians perceived Westerns as representing a set of values about land, autonomy, andfreedom, while Anglos linked Western myth to their own history and turned into an affirmation of values their ancestors strove for and imposed on West. These results imply that meaning imputed to cultural works varies over social space. Lack of data on audience interpretations of cultural products has rendered existing models of cultural significance of Western films and other genres speculative. T he dominant approach to understanding cultural products typically selects a particular popular genre for analysis in hope of generating conclusions about societal values expressed in cultural product (some exceptions are Radway 1984; Griswold 1987; and Liebes and Katz 1990).1 For example, Cawelti (1970, 1976), on basis of his reading of Western novels, concluded that these novels are a vehicle for exploring value conflicts, such as communal ideas versus individualistic impulses, and traditional ways of life versus progress. Cawelti argued that Westerns are formulaic works that provide readers with a vehicle for escape and moral fantasy. In major sociological study of Western films, Wright (1977) used his own viewing of most popular Western movies from 1931 to 1972 to argue that Westerns resemble primitive myths. Drawing on Levi-Strauss, Wright developed a cognitive theory of mythic structures in which the receivers of Western myth learn how to act by recognizing their own situation in it (p. 186). Wright's main thesis is that narrative themes of Western resolve crucial contradictions in modern capitalism and provide viewers with strategies to deal with their economic worlds. The popularity of Westerns, Wright argued, lies in genre's reflection of changing economic system, which allows viewers to use Western as a guide for living. These explanations of Western's popularity attend to cultural texts but ignore viewers, whose motives and experiences are crucial. The lack of solid data about audience interpretations of various formulas renders existing models of cultural significance of Westerns and other genres speculative."

I start with what seems to be a technical problem in the philosophy of science, namely, whether it is possible to demarcate criteria for demarcating science from nonscience. Recent philosophers have despaired of finding such meta-boundaries and as a result have begun to call into question the very identity of the philosophy of science. Against this line of reasoning, I argue that the failure of the demarcation project only shows that attempts to study science scientifically, as the philosophers have wanted to do, tend to result in science deconstructing its identity. But, clearly, the epistemic authority of science has worked to block such self-deconstructive moves in the normal course of inquiry. How? I propose a strategy for addressing this question, namely, to examine how science exercises worldly power by rhetorically drawing our attention to the fact that scientific knowledge repre-"

Much literature deals with the link between migration and inequalities indirectly, often through topics such as migration and development or the integration of migrants. Surprisingly, little research addresses directly the role of social inequalities. This gap raises at least two major questions: First, how do social inequalities affect opportunities for cross-border migration for different socioeconomic groups? Second, conversely, how do the outcomes of migration affect social inequalities in global patterns of distribution and in life chances in the countries of emigration and of immigration? Of ultimate interest is whether migration buttresses the dominant forms of social stratification or transforms the distribution of valued goods in a fundamental way. Overall, this review suggests that cross-border migration both constitutes a path to upward social mobility for migrants and tends to reinforce durable inequalities on a deeper level."

Drawing on document analysis and ethnographic methods, this paper examines the politics around Colombia's 2005 census. I argue that Afro-Colombian organizations were successful in pressuring the state to move beyond the purely cultural notions of blackness institutionalized in the 1991 constitution and toward a broader ethno-racial Afro-Colombian category in the 2005 census. However, their success required them not only to situate their claims in international mandates and domestic law, but also to grapple with competing definitions of blackness within the movement itself. In this way, the Afro-Colombian movement has been an important actor in shaping how ‘official’ ethno-racial categories are made and remade in Colombia. This case not only sheds light on the politics of multiculturalism in Latin America more generally, but raises questions about how we understand ‘race’ ve..."

Although the literature on this issue has become substantial no one has yet provided a systematic examination of changes in the earnings’ gap that takes into consideration the concomitant changes in the occupational structure and changes in the racial composition of occupational labor markets as well as changes in characteristics of the labor force. In the present research, we use 5 waves of IPUMS data and hierarchical linear modeling to estimate changes in the effect of race on earnings between 1960 and 2000. The models focus on the interaction of time and race with earnings while controlling for individual-level characteristics (i.e. education) at the individual-level and the characteristics of detailed occupational labor markets (i.e. occupational socioeconomic status, race and gender composition, occupational earnings inequality) at the aggregate level. In order to evaluate the effect of change over time, both linear and non-linear trends in earning gaps are estimated in the labor market as a whole and separately for the public and private sectors. The data reveal that net of changes in the occupational distributions and market-relevant characteristics of Black and White men, the gaps have generally narrowed but at a declining rate. The data also reveal considerable differences in racial earnings inequality between the public and the private sectors. Whereas the unexplained earnings gap in the public sector has virtually vanished by 2000, in the private sector, the gap is still significant, although it declined over time. The findings are discussed in light of past research in order to re-evaluate the contribution of labor market attributes and sector differences to change in earnings disparities between Black and White men in the US."
W2073319993,0020-7314,['Fernando Riosmena'],"This article compares the transition into legal permanent residence (LPR) of Mexicans, Dominicans, and Nicaraguans. Dominicans had the highest likelihood of obtaining such residence, mostly sponsored by parents and spouses. Mexicans had the lowest LPR transition rates and presented sharp gender differentials in modes: women were found to be mostly legalized through husbands, while men were sponsored by their parents or through provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). Nicaraguans stood in between, presenting few gender differences in rates and modes of transition and a heavy dependence on asylum and special provisions in immigration legislation.

The principal tool in this effort is language: the Spanish language is proxy for the “mass” of lower socioeconomic class Hispanic audience; English language usage by Hispanics is the sign of a higher class of Hispanic audience. The clearly defined panethnic conceptualization of the Hispanic audience, the nexus of which is the Spanish language, has been blurred.

Data was derived from vital statistics birth records for the period 1982-97. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established minimum categories for the collection, record keeping and presentation of data by race and ethnicity. These categories were used by the Census Bureau to identify the respondents' race and ethnicity. But these categories proved to be incompetent for they no longer reflected the increasing diversity of the nation. So by 1997, after the comprehensive review, the OMB announced a revision of the federal guidelines for data collection by race and ethnicity. The guidelines will help respondents in selecting one or more racial categories. After the revision, the guidelines helped in providing a clear picture of the multiracial status; it showed an increase in multiracial or ethnic births from 12% in 1982 to 14% in 1997, which they were more common among native-born mothers than among foreign-born mothers. In 1997, approximately 20% of native-born mothers, but only 7% of foreign-born mothers gave birth to children of mixed race or ethnicity. This report suggests this issue must be confronted, that is, how to ensure the civil rights of the population that has outgrown the monoracial categories upon which the civil rights laws have been interpreted."

The popular usage is characteristically non-discriminating. It ignores any question concerning the proportion of Negro and white in the ancestry of the mixed bloods, and it fails to discriminate between the offspring of primary race crossings and the descendants of a mixed-blood ancestry. Consequently the term includes Negroes with any perceptible trace of white admixture and white persons with only a touch of Negro color. It includes individuals one of whose parents is Negro and the other white as well as individuals one of whose parents, or both, is of mixed blood."

More specifically, we assert that an answer to an attitude question is the product of a fourstage process. Respondents first interpret the attitude question, determining what attitude the question is about. They then retrieve relevant beliefs and feelings. Next, they apply these beliefs and feelings in rendering the appropriate judgment. Finally, they use this judgment to select a response. All four of the component processes can be affected by prior items. The prior items can provide a framework for interpreting later questions and can also make some responses appear to be redundant with earlier answers. The prior items can prime some beliefs, making them more accessible to the retrieval process. The prior items can suggest a norm or standard of comparison for making the judgment. Finally, the prior items can create consistency pressures or pressures to appear moderate. Because of the multiple processes involved, context effects are difficult to predict and sometimes difficult to replicate. We attempt to sort out when context is likely to affect later responses and include a list of the variables that affect the size and direction of the effects of context."

We highlight how the aesthetic logic that traditionally informs the practices of the symphony yielded, in the face of declining orchestral resources, to a more commercially oriented market logic. As institutionalists have argued, shifts in logics are often catalysed by exogenous shocks. In the ASO, this blending of aesthetic and market logics became salient in the wake of a pivotal organizational event, the 1996 musicians’ strike. Qualitatively comparing pre- and post-strike reviews of ASO performances, we find that the discourse of critics shifted to capture the changing logic of the symphony: post-strike reviews were more attuned to market than aesthetic aspects of the symphony. Nonetheless, their reviews suggested that judgments based on notions of cultural authenticity were virtually unaffected. Although our results echo existing claims that art world critics often act in a ritualistic fashion, serving as gatekeepers for the authenticity of cultural genres, we extend scholarship by highlighting how critics’ stories are embedded in broader discursive fields that reveal how they patrol the boundaries of genres."

Yet the political process often gives rise to institutions that are good for some people and bad for others, depending on who has the power to impose their will. Political institutions may be structures of cooperation, but they may also be structures of power—and the theory does not tell us much about this. As a result, it gives us a one-sided and overly benign view of what political institutions are and do. This problem is not well understood, and indeed is not typically seen as a problem at all. For there is a widespread sense in the rational choice literature that, because power is frequently discussed, it is an integral part of the theory and just as fundamental as cooperation. Confusion on this score has undermined efforts to right the imbalance. My purpose here is to clarify the analytic roles that power and cooperation actually play in this literature, and to argue that a more balanced theory—one that brings power from its periphery to its very core—is both necessary and entirely possible.Terry M.

In the absence of nuclear war, leaders' expectations of nuclear war and of its control were affected by causal theories and abstract propositions and models which, given their “scientific” and technical nature, were developed by an epistemic community. This study, which emphasizes the roles played by epistemic communities in policy innovation and in the diffusion of understandings across nations and communities, analyzes how the theoretical and practical ideas of the arms control epistemic community became political expectations, were diffused to the Soviet Union, and were ultimately embodied in the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) arms control treaty. In contrast to those studies that have concentrated primarily on the workings of international epistemic communities, this study stresses the notion that domestically developed theoretical expectations, which were worked out by a national group of experts and selected by the American government as the basis for negotiations with the Soviets, became the seed of the ABM regime. Moreover, by suggesting that the arms control epistemic community was really an aggregation of several factions that shared common ground against various intellectual and policy rivals, this study sheds light on the question of how much coherence an epistemic community requires. The political selection of new conceptual understandings, followed by their retention and diffusion at national and international levels, suggests an evolutionary approach at odds with explanations of international change advanced by structural realism and approaches based on it."

Over the last several years, the international system - particularly as embodied in the United Nations and other international institutions - has exhibited a renewed and increasingly heightened focus on the concerns of indigenous peoples. Anaya discusses the resulting new generation of international treaty and customary norms, while linking the new and emergent norms with previously existing international human rights standards of general applicability.

The first approach accounts for strong ethnic attachments on the basis of their ineffable affective significance. Moreover, this affective significance most often surrounds images of the group's distinctive past, thus giving a historical dimension to the concept of primordialism. The second approach views ethnic group solidarity as resulting from certain social circumstances, both internal and external, under which the members of the group exist. It is argued that neither approach alone offers a sufficient explanation ‐ i.e., that the primordial approach cannot readily account for fluctuating ethnic group solidarity and that the circumstantial approach tends to ignore the affective significance of ethnic ties ‐ and that previous attempts to synthesize them have been inadequate as explanatory models. Such a synthetic model is offered, which is based on the oppositional approach originated by Edward Spicer and which maintains that fluctuating ethnicity, along with fluctuating primordial sentiments, can be best explained on the basis of the circumstance of fluctuating opposition."

Regression analyses reveal that increasing omnivorousness is due both to cohort replacement and to changes over the 1980s among highbrows of all ages.

Our empirical site is the Progressive movement and the early thrift industry in California. We draw on social-movement research and organizational theory to argue that a new ideal of thrift, bureaucratized cooperation among strangers, replaced the original idea of thrift, friendly cooperation among neighbors. This shift was possible only after the modernizing temper of Progressivism gave rise to two institutions, the news media and role-model organizations, that made bureaucracy culturally appropriate. The bureaucratization of thrift occurred even though it resulted in a centralization of power, which clashed with the Progressive ideal of equitably distributing power.

One-third of claimants themselves report some degree of stigma around their claim. Against the predictions of ‘dependency culture’ claims, however, respondents in high-claim areas were more likely to stigmatise benefits, both before and after accounting for other factors. The paper concludes by considering lessons for future benefits stigma studies, and policy options to reduce benefits stigma."

This paper examines findings from the new ancestry question from the perspective of measuring ethnicity. The question adds little information about Hispanics, racial minorities, or recent immigrants, who can be identified readily on the basis of other census inquiries. The ancestry question allows us to characterize the descendants of European immigrants, but because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate present respondents from their forebears, and the apparent unimportance of ancestry to many whites of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent. In regard to these groups, we may now be in an era of optional ethnicity, in which no simple census question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity."

This study independently manipulated skin color and facial physiognomy to determine their relative weighting in racial categorization. Participants (N = 250) judged faces varying on 10 levels of facial physiognomy (from Afrocentric to Eurocentric) and 10 levels of skin color (from dark to light) under either no time constraints, a modest time constraint, and under a stringent time constraint. Skin color was a powerful predictor of racial typicality ratings at all levels of facial physiognomy, but participants relied upon facial physiognomy more when rating faces of light than dark skin color. Skin color was a more important cue than facial physiognomy under no time constraints, but as time constraints became more severe, skin color's importance decreased, yet it remained a more important cue at extreme physiognomy levels. The relationship between skin color and racial typicality ratings was stronger for those with more negative implicit racial attitudes. These findings suggest the primary role of skin color in racial categorization and underscore the importance of implicit attitudes in explicit categorization judgments."

The various adaptive strategies employed by the Paiute to cope with resource depletion, pressures to relinquish traditional ethnicity patterns, and depopulation are examined. Since the Kaibab Paiute were one of the last Native American peoples to resist Euroamerican expansion, a study of their case permits an assessment of the process and implications of the Invasion of America (Jennings 1975) from a perspective of more than 300 years. Today as never before the talents of behavioral and social scientists are being focused upon the issue of how ethnic groups compete with one another for scarce social and environmental resources. Some researchers are discussing the process of group competition from a cultural ecological perspective (Bennett 1969, 1976; Harner 1977;Polgar 1975). Others perceive of the issue in terms of cultural persistence (Barth 1969; Depres 1967, 1975; Fitzgerald 1966; Hoetink 1971; Spicer 1971 ;Whitten 1974).

W4238933824,0141-9870,['Charles Tilly'],"In a dazzling new interpretation of four hundred years of modern French history, Charles Tilly focuses not on kings and courtiers but on the common people of village and farm buffeted by the inexorable advance of large-scale capitalism and the consolidation of a powerful nation-state. Tilly, author of The Vendée and many other books, chooses the contention of the masses as his medium in painting this vivid picture of the people's growing ability and willingness to fight injustice, challenge exploitation, and claim their own place in the hierarchy of power. Contention is not necessarily disorder. The more we look at contention, says Tilly, the more we discover order created by the rooting of collective action in everyday social life through a continuous process of signaling, negotiation, and struggle. In seventeenth-century France, ordinary people did not know how to demonstrate, rally, or strike, but they had standard procedures for expelling a tax collector, undermining a corrupt official, and shaming moral offenders. By the end of the eighteenth century, French people were experimenting with delegations, public meetings, and popular justice. Through the nineteenth century, with the growth of an industrial proletariat, they developed an extensive repertoire of strikes, demonstrations, and direct attacks on landlords and capitalists, as well as conflicts setting worker against worker. In the twentieth century, scenarios of protest expanded to even larger-scale forms such as mass meetings, electoral campaigns, and broad-based social movements. Rather than arguing these developments in the abstract, The Contentious French provides lively descriptions of real events, with pauses to make sense of their patterns. The result is a view of politics with the common struggle for power at its core and the changing structure of power as its envelope. The Contentious French is bound to be controversial, and therefore required reading for specialists in European history, social movements, and collective action. Its fresh approach will also appeal to students and general readers."
W4246346168,0003-1224,['Andreas Wimmer'],"Abstract The book introduces a new theory that overcomes essentializing approaches to ethnicity all the while avoiding the pitfalls of excessive constructivism. It suggests understanding ethnic/racial boundaries as the outcome of a negotiation process between actors who pursue different boundary making strategies, depending on institutional incentives, their position within power hierarchies, and their pre-existing networks of alliances. This theory contrast with mainstream approaches in the social sciences, where ethnic groups are often treated as self-evident units of observation and ethnic culture and solidarity as self-explanatory variables, thus overlooking the process through which certain ethnic cleavages but not others become culturally meaningful, politically salient, and associated with dense networks of solidarity. By paying systematic attention to variation in the nature of ethnic boundaries, the book also overcomes the exclusive focus on fluidity, malleability, and contextual instability that characterizes radically constructivist approaches. This book introduces a series of epistemological principles, theoretical stances, research designs, and modes of interpretation that allow to disentangle ethnic from other processes of group formation and to assess in how far ethnic boundaries structure the allocation of resources, invite political passion, and represent primary aspects of individual identity. Using a variety of qualitative and quantitative research techniques, several chapters exemplify how this agenda can be realized in concrete empirical research: on how local residents in immigrant neighborhoods draw symbolic boundaries against each other, on the ethnic and racial composition of friendship networks, and how ethnic closure influences the cultural values of Europeans."

Approaching racism from structural and social process perspectives, we seek to understand the social consequences of enforcement practices in the lives of undocumented immigrant young adults who moved to the United States as minors. Findings indicate that although legal discourse regarding immigration enforcement theoretically purports colorblindness, racial practices such as profiling subject immigrants to arrest, detention, and deportation and, in effect, criminalize them. Further, enforcement practices produce distress, vulnerability, and anxiety in the lives of young immigrants and their families, often resulting in legitimate fears of detention and deportation since enforcement measures disproportionately affect Latinos and other racialized immigrant groups in U.S. society. We conclude that policies and programs that exclude, segregate, detain, and physically remove immigrants from the country reproduce racial inequalities in other areas of social life through spillover effects that result in dire consequences for these immigrants and their kin.

The attention the country has received, especially in the annals of North American social science, derives from its lack of legally sanctioned discrimination since slavery was abolished in 1888 and its long history of widespread miscegenation, resulting in an elaborate system of multiracial classification. These unique characteristics contributed to the widely held view that Brazil, unlike the United States, could be described as a racial democracy, free of violence, segregation, and discrimination. This image, although accurate in some respects, has eroded in recent years, largely because of the findings of empirical research and increased public awareness of the discrimination that occurs in everyday life. After decades of silence, race has emerged as a legitimate topic of research and as a rallying cry for a host of cultural and political organizations. For all of the nuance and complexity embedded in the social meaning of skin color in Brazil, there is a growing body of empirical evidence that offers important insights into its relationship to identity, inequality, and discrimination. These findings draw heavily on census and survey data, which are hardly ideal sources of information on topics of such extraordinary intricacy. In the face of some obvious limitations, however, with appropriate caveats it is possible to derive meaningful conclusions from the large samples afforded by national censuses and surveys.

AV uses regression models to predict educational attainment, occupational status and household income for Mexicans by ethnicity and according to three skin color categories. He finds that the darkest skin tone individuals have the lowest socioeconomic status followed by those with intermediate skin colors on all these outcomes, even after controlling for individual characteristics. AV does us an important service by drawing our attention to the role of skin color in Mexican social stratification, which has generally been denied or overlooked. However, we argue that AV overstates the effects of skin color on class in Mexican society because he ignores class origins, he uses a highly subjective skin color indicator that is itself affected by class, and he misidentifies indigenous ethnicity.

In this comment, we find general support for AV’s conclusions about the effect of skin color in the Mexican stratification system, especially in educational attainment, but class origins are a more dominant factor in Mexican social stratification and they explain some of the apparent skin color differences that AV found. By controlling for class origins and by using more accurate measures of color and indigenous ethnicity, we discover that the magnitude of indigenous and skin color disadvantage is smaller than AV finds in the case of educational attainment. Class origins and educationi largely explain color differences in occupational status while color and indigenous identity have virtually no effect. We have sought to replicate AV’s analysis on most variables since we believe it is excellent methodologically, except that we use innovative and new data that better capture color, indigenous ethnicity, and class origins. We show that the rest of our coefficients are very similar to those in a model that replicates the same variables used in one of AV’s models, suggesting that our data, variables and statistical methods closely match his. We realize that the shortcomings we find for AV are mostly due to his use of a data set that was not designed for this end."

We explore racial differences in self-rated health between whites and several single and multiracial adults with binary logistic regression analyses and investigate whether placing these groups into a self-reported “best race” category alters patterns of health disparities. We propose four hypotheses that predict how the self-rated health status of specific multiracial groups compares with their respective component single-race counterparts, and we find substantial complexity in that no one explanatory model applies to all multiracial combinations. We also find that placing multiracial groups into a single “best race” category likely obscures the pattern of health disparities for selected groups because some multiracial adults (e.g., American Indians) tend to identify with single-race groups whose health experience they do not share."

Since the people involved were officially regarded as ‘coloured’ people, their assertion of Nama identity is, clearly, part of the current, widespread debate about the meaning and significance of ‘coloured’ identity in a future South Africa. But it also has an important local dynamic, in that it was closely linked to the establishment of the Richtersveld National Park in Namaqualand in 1991. The main aim of this paper is to unravel the local dynamic of Nama identity. We believe, for reasons set out below, that this statement of Nama ethnic identity is a carefully controlled performance. It is role‐play, a highly self‐conscious statement of ‘who we are’ that is being formulated collectively through dialogue, and modified according to context. It seems to us that the manner in which Nama identity is being performed contrasts sharply with the way in which Zulu identity is currently portrayed by Inkatha. In this paper, we attempt to explain the notion of ethnic identity as controlled performance, to show why Nama ethnic identity should take this form, and to explore the contrast between the way in which people in the north‐west Cape interpret their ‘Namaness’ and Inkatha's interpretation of ‘Zuluness’. We argue, in relation to the third of these goals, that comparative analysis has the potential to provide important insights in the complex field of ethnic identity formation and ethnic mobilisation, and suggest that too little of this kind of analysis takes place in South Africa."

The problems of interacting cause actors to automatically sex-categorize others and, thus, to cue gender stereotypes that have various effects on interactional outcomes, usually by modifying the performance of other, more salient identities. Because changes in the status dimension of gender stereotypes lag behind changes in resource inequalities, interactional status processes can reestablish gender inequalities in new structural forms. Interactional sex categorization also biases the choice of comparison others, causing men and women to judge differently the rewards available to them. Operating in workplace relations, these processes conserve inequality by driving the gender-labeling of jobs, constructing people as gender-interested actors, contributing to employers' discriminatory preferences, and mediating men's and women's perceptions of alternatives and their willingness to settle for given job outcomes."

The available data suggest that the current strategy of border enforcement has resulted in rechanneling flows of unauthorized migrants to more hazardous areas, raising fees charged by people-smugglers, and discouraging unauthorized migrants already in the US from returning to their places of origin. However, there is no evidence that the strategy is deterring or preventing significant numbers of new illegal entries, particularly given the absence of a serious effort to curtail employment of unauthorized migrants through worksite enforcement.

In Latin America, the two sets of concepts have particularly overlapped. In the rest of the world, particularly in Asia, color and colorism have also been important but have evolved separately from the relatively new concepts of race and racism. In recent years, however, color consciousness and white supremacy appear to have been increasingly united, globalized, and commodified, as exemplified by the global multibillion-dollar skin-lightening industry. Finally, we document the growing methodological attention to measurements of skin color and social science data that incorporate skin color measures."

Laurence'],"This book traces how governments across Western Europe have responded to the growing presence of Muslim immigrants in their countries over the past fifty years. Drawing on hundreds of in-depth interviews with government officials and religious leaders in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Turkey, the book challenges the widespread notion that Europe's Muslim minorities represent a threat to liberal democracy. The book documents how European governments in the 1970s and 1980s excluded Islam from domestic institutions, instead inviting foreign powers like Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Turkey to oversee the practice of Islam among immigrants in European host societies. But since the 1990s, amid rising integration problems and fears about terrorism, governments have aggressively stepped up efforts to reach out to their Muslim communities and incorporate them into the institutional, political, and cultural fabrics of European democracy. The book places these efforts—particularly the government-led creation of Islamic councils—within a broader theoretical context and gleans insights from government interactions with groups such as trade unions and Jewish communities at previous critical junctures in European state-building. By examining how state–mosque relations in Europe are linked to the ongoing struggle for religious and political authority in the Muslim-majority world, the book sheds light on the geopolitical implications of a religious minority's transition from outsiders to citizens. This book offers a much-needed reassessment that foresees the continuing integration of Muslims into European civil society and politics in the coming decades."

SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO, attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year because of its picturesque plaza, its historic role as a Spanish imperial capital, its nearby Indian pueblos, its wealth of museums, and its cultural events-and its ski slopes. It has an image as an Old World haven where one can meet the American Other, the unassimilated Native American culture. Perhaps the closest most visitors will get to real Indians is by strolling along the Portal of the Palace of the Governors, the oldest public building in the United States and now part of the Museum of New Mexico. Here, under this covered walkway spanning one side of the central plaza, the Indians display and sell their wares: jewelry, pottery, sand paintings, food, and occasionally other handicrafts. Sitting with their backs to the stuccoed adobe palace wall, they arrange their wares neatly on blankets in front of them. On a busy day 50 or so Indians and myriad tourists are crammed into this long corridor. The Indians, mostly from the nearby pueblos but also from the Navaho, Zuni, and Hopi reservations and further afield, are there every day in the summer. Many even brave the cold winter days and sit huddled in rugs. For the Indian, selling under the Portal is a financial necessity; for the visitors, the Portal provides comfortable surroundings to see and buy genuine Indian crafts from genuine Indian craftsmen, apparently without the distancing factor of middlemen."

Moreover, a culture that forces some of its members to repress to the extreme their ego gratification and sense of importance is inevitably unstable, disintegrated, and pregnant with social conflicts. There remains in this brief discussion to ask: What implications does this study have for social science instruction? The writer proceeds from the assumption that problems of the nature just described impose an obligation on social science teachers to aid in resolving this mental conflict among Negro youth. From the data, it is immediately obvious, and the writer advances the generalization that Negro youth are intra-racially prejudiced, and defensively so, primarily because of the operation of divergent social forces and contradictory racial mores. Thereby, the writer invalidates the assumption made by a number of professional educators that inadequacy of social science instructional methods and materials for instruction are responsible for the racial prejudice and defensiveness of Negro students. That view, to be sure, oversimplifies the proposition and takes no account of the fact that inadequate materials for teaching and unsuitable teaching methods in the social studies merely reflect the paradoxical features of the social structure. Moreover, it is extremely naive to expect that instruction, in a discipline or field of knowledge, even if perfect in methodology and objectively exhaustive in content materials can counteract a total universe of interacting and inconsistent ideologies with their combination of resisting folkways and mores. In other words, social science instruction may aggravate or it may alleviate social problems, but the basic remedy is to be sought, not in whether the problem approach or the systematic approach is employed, nor in whether white or Negro characters are emphasized, say in a course in history, but by an analysis of the inconsistencies that exist in the societal structure so that value judgments may be made in the light of this knowledge. If social science instruction is to aid in clearing up the frustration and emotional conflict of Negro youth, teachers must saturate them with a problem solving consciousness. This is not to say, however, that these students should be imbued with this or that particular ism, or indoctrinated with reform techniques. Rather, it means that social science instructors should make their youth aware of the nature of their societal structure and aid them in developing reasoned value judgments and action patterns to meet the problems of a dynamic society."

We use a causal inference approach based on nationally-representative survey experiments applied door-to-door in Mexico and Peru to examine whether material incentives can indeed encourage indigenous identification. Our results are counterintuitive. Reminding respondents of potential material benefits of indigenous identification does not increase such identification. It reduces it. We theorize this negative effect may be driven by the fact that receiving social benefits is stigmatized. Our findings call into question critics’ concerns that ethnic-based redistributive policies necessarily incentivize ethnic identification.

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms."

To the degree that anthropology is an official discipline predicated on the distinction between Self and the alien Other which it presumes to represent, the deterioration of the borders and boundaries of the nation-state have serious implications for its epistemology and legitimacy and its power of representation of transnational communities and of difference in general.

While domination describes systems of control and coercion, negotiation addresses the ways women and men bargain for privileges and resources. Consciousness assumes various forms ranging from gender awareness to feminist/anti-feminist consciousness, and is conceived as a process which develops dialectically in the social relations of the sexes. We argue that this conceptual framework produces a more sensitive and complex set of analytical tools for understanding gender relations."

To answer this question, we assess patterns of ethnic and religious identity and practice as well as their interrelation among Dutch Turks and Moroccans. Classical assimilation theories predict a decline in ethnic attachment over generations, but are less clear on consequences of migration on religious attachment. We use quantitative analysis to test propositions among first and second generation minorities (N = 1,861). Our data indicate that the second generation reports weaker ethnic and religious identities, and engages less in ethno-cultural and religious practices. We do find, however, that religious and ethnic identity become increasingly related for the second generation. These differences can only partly be accounted for by differences in education, employment and life course events."

The common threat of internal division posed by subnational movements is a widely faced challenge shared by a diverse array of countries around the world. The rise of ethnic politics since the Second World War is best understood when ethnic mobilization is seen as a process of emergent group interests rather than simply the manifestation of primordial sentiments. This paper examines five essentially similar processes in both new and old states: urbanization, increased scales of organization, expansion of secondary and tertiary economic sectors, expansion of the political sector, and emergence of supranational organizations. Instead of reducing ethnic differences in favor of national-level identities, these development processes promote ethnic mobilization by increasing economic and political competition and organizing it on the basis of ethnicity."

However, in regions of the United States where the recent growth of the Indian population has been particularly sharp most married Indians are married to non‐Indians. Fertility rates of women who are part of intermarried couples are lower than fertility rates for Indian women in racially endogamous marriages.

Despite growing interest in the biracial population, there is little research on their psychological and socioeconomic outcomes. Does biracial status confer a relative disadvantage in psychological adaptation as early theorists warned? In turn, do biracials benefit in their socioeconomic outcomes relative to their ethnic counterparts? Using a nationally representative data set of youth (the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988), this article examines whether biracial youths encounter greater psychological difficulties as previous theorists suggest. I also examine whether the school outcomes of biracials more closely resemble that of their minority or white counterparts. The recent acknowledgment of multiracial persons stands at odds with popular assumptions of racial and ethnic categories as immutable and unchanging as well as the assumed exclusiveness of racial groups in the United States. 2 Mixed racial status, although not officially recognized, [End Page 223] may have important policy implications and brings to question race-based policies, even those enacted to protect minorities. For example, in 1993, seven-year-old Brianna Combash was classified as black on her California school records. Because she is classified as black, the school district cannot administer an IQ test to her, which has been recommended by school psychologists as an aid in diagnosing the specific nature of her learning problems. The ban on IQ tests for black children was the result of a court ruling about a decade ago meant to protect black children from being labeled “mentally retarded.” However, because Brianna is actually biracial and happens to have a white mother, her mother has the option of changing Brianna’s racial designation to white, hence allowing the school to administer an IQ test. Otherwise, she would have to pay for a privately administered IQ test. As Brianna’s mother put it, “If I changed her race, I’d have to hide that from her. She’s seven. She’s already aware of different races and has feelings about being brown. Do I want to do something I would have to hide from her? Which is the greater good?” 3 Although biracials are often forced to choose a single racial designation over another on official documents, in reality, their racial status may be somewhat ambiguous. In some respects, biracials have been seen as “marginal” people in a society where identification with a single racial group is the norm. 4 Biracials may not be accepted by either of their monoracial peer groups, nor do they benefit from adequate racial socialization by parents because neither parent is biracial. In addition, biracial children from comparable family backgrounds can have very different life experiences based on their physical appearance. For instance, an Asian-white youth who has typically “Asian” physical attributes may experience little problem in gaining acceptance among other Asians but will be unable to pass for White. Another Asian-white youth may have more features typically associated with Whites, while another has more ambiguous features. These three Asian-white youths will experience differential treatment by others based on their appearance, and these experiences can shape the way they self-identify. For biracial blacks, one’s lighter skin color may preclude socializing with blacks, while darker skinned biracials may find it difficult to identify with Whites. [End Page 224] Previous Research Biracials It is notable that some of the earliest essays by the Chicago School on race and assimilation examined how understanding “the marginal man,” a category that includes individuals of mixed race ancestry, can lead to a clearer conception of social change. Specifically, because the position of the marginal man clearly demarcates the significant boundaries of the day, it acts as a lens to the dynamic process of group interaction among immigrants and natives as well as among racial groups.

These identities are expressed through the pattern of voting choices that individuals make during successive elections. The authors based their analysis on a 1993 panel survey of a national sample of the adult Polish population first interviewed in 1988. They show that when political identity is conceptualized in a dynamic manner, the majority of the Polish electorate exhibit patterns of electoral choice that conform well to interpretable types of political identity.

Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic.

We then apply the model to understand simple forms of discrimination and social identity. It is shown that discrimination in hiring can result from such cognitive processes even when there is no malevolent taste to do so and workers' qualifications are fully observable.

In this paper we describe a schism in Santa Clara Pueblo which began in 1894 and finally ended in 1935 with the adoption of an elective form of gov? ernment under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. The general nature of Pueblo factionalism is also discussed, and an attempt is made to explain the persistence of these villages despite internal conflict and external pres? sures. Santa Clara Pueblo is one of six Tewa-speaking communities in the Tewa basin between Sante Fe and Taos in northern New Mexico. The other five villages are San Juan, San Ildefonso, Nambe, Pojoaque, and Tesuque. An? other Tewa pueblo, Hano, is located in Arizona among the Hopi Pueblos. Although Hano speaks a language intelligible to the Tewa of the New Mex? ico pueblos, their culture is sufficiently different to consider them culturally distinct from the New Mexico Tewa. Studies of the New Mexico Tewa (Harrington 1916; Parsons 1929; Whitman 1947) indicate that their cultures are fairly uniform. Frequent intermarriages, ceremonial co-operation, and constant social interaction among these peoples have undoubtedly been re? sponsible for their similarities. The population of Santa Clara Pueblo has increased rapidly since the nineteenth century. According to estimates in Hodge (1910: 325), it rose from 187 in 1889 to 325 in 1905. Parsons (1929: 9) reported a figure of 354 in 1926, a census showed 440 in 1934, and the present population is about 600.

El asunto principal a tratar es ver como la politica local se convierte en parte de la global, como se da el rejuego entre estos dos niveles politicos y como ambos contribuyen a la creacion de una nueva identidad politica: la neozapatista.

The reforms of the 1980s, whilst at times appearing to lose momentum and direction, none the less can be seen as a consistent strategy of ‘economic liberalism’, defined broadly as one of reducing the size of the State sector and allowing markets greater scope for determining resource allocation. A recent Banco de México survey sets out clearly the redefinition of the appropriate role of the State in the liberalism model. The reform of the public sector has sought to exclude it from commercial activities and to concentrate its action on basic functions of the State and the development of an economic framework that stimulates the efficient use of resources by the private sector. The public sector now concentrates on the provision of health and education services, the fight against poverty, the provision of infrastructure and the administration of justice and other traditional public services (Banco de México, 1993:164)."

These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation."

Deborah Yashar explains the contemporary and uneven emergence of Latin American indigenous movements - addressing both why indigenous identities have become politically salient in the contemporary period and why they have translated into significant political organizations in some places and not others. She argues that ethnic politics can best be explained through a comparative historical approach that analyzes three factors: changing citizenship regimes, social networks, and political associational space. Her argument provides insight into the fragility and unevenness of Latin America's third wave democracies and has broader implications for the ways in which we theorize the relationship between citizenship, states, identity, and social action."

W2076199193,1475-1461,['Vincent Kang Fu'],"Abstract Most studies of racial intermarriage rely on the prevalence of intermarriage to measure the strength of group boundaries, without scrutinizing the nature of intermarriage pairings. Examination of intermarried couples’ characteristics reveals (1) that intermarriages and endogamous marriages follow different patterns, and (2) that intermarriage pairings for some groups reflect a generalized racial status hierarchy. According to evidence from the 1990 U.S. Census PUMS, patterns in blacks’ and Mexican Americans’ marriages with whites suggest that a generalized racial status hierarchy disadvantages members of these minority groups. For marriages between Japanese Americans and whites, however, crossing the group boundary does not affect couples’ characteristics."

The approach flowing from the concept proposed here permits the observer to examine empirical variations that tend to be treated as rigid assumptions by modernization analysts on the one hand and class analysts on the other. The concept is applied to a study of the Nubians of Uganda because of the intermixture of class and ethnic features involved in their fall from status at the beginning of the colonial period and their subsequent sudden rise following the 1071 coup d'état of Idi Amin. The fairly recent creation of the Nubians as an ethnic category and the relative ease with which others can become members illustrate other features of the proposed concept of ethnicity. Finally, this concept is used to examine and criticize overly restrictive notions of ethnicity found in theories based upon both cultural pluralism and consociationalism."

W2914232498,0276-8739,"['Greta R. Bauer', 'Ayden I. Scheim']","Intersectionality as a theoretical framework has gained prominence in qualitative research on social inequity. Intercategorical quantitative applications have focused primarily on describing health or social inequalities across intersectional groups, coded using cross-classified categories or interaction terms. This descriptive intersectionality omits consideration of the mediating processes (e.g., discrimination) through which intersectional positions impact outcome inequalities, which offer opportunities for intervention. We argue for the importance of a quantitative analytic intersectionality. We identify methodological challenges and potential solutions in structuring studies to allow for both intersectional heterogeneity in outcomes and in the ways that processes such as discrimination may cause these outcomes for those at different intersections. To incorporate both mediation and exposure-mediator interaction, we use VanderWeele's three-way decomposition methodology, adapt the interpretation for application to analytic intersectionality studies, and present a step-by-step analytic approach. Using online panel data collected from Canada and the United States in 2016 (N = 2542), we illustrate this approach with a statistical analysis of whether and to what extent observed inequalities in psychological distress across intersections of ethnoracial group and sexual or gender minority (SGM) status may be explained by past-year experiences of day-to-day discrimination, assessed using the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI). We describe actual and adjusted intersectional inequalities in psychological distress and decompose them to identify three component effects for each of 11 intersectional comparison groups (e.g., Indigenous SGM), versus the reference intersectional group that experienced the lowest levels of discrimination (white non-SGM). These reflect the expected inequality in outcome: 1) due to membership in the more discriminated-against group, if its members had experienced the same lower levels of discrimination as the reference intersection; 2) due to unequal levels of discrimination; and 3), due to unequal effects of discrimination. We present considerations for use and interpretation of these methods."

As hypothesized, bivariate and multi-variate results reveal a compelling race-of-the-interviewer effect for both black and white respondents: White interviewers reported the skin tones of black respondents as substantially darker than did black interviewers. In turn, black interviewers categorized the skin tones of white respondents as much lighter than did white interviewers. Results also indicate that interviewers perceived greater variation in the skin tones of same-race respondents than among other-race respondents, suggesting that both black and white Americans exhibit relatively limited ability to carefully distinguish the physical characteristics of other-race persons. Finally, results show that unsuccessful attempts to match interviewers and respondents by race may have the unintended consequence of introducing important attenuating biases into analyses involving skin color.

W2081160446,1354-0661,['Martha E. Gimenez'],"Public health specialists, policy makers, social scientists, and politicians, for different reasons, have welcomed the ""Hispanic"" label. The label presumably identifies an ethnic group that is also a minority group (i.e., a group historically subject to economic exploitation and racial discrimination). Consequently, its consistent use by federal and state agencies would produce large quantities of comparable data useful for research, and for policy making and implementation. Critics have argued that the label is racist, it mystifies the real reasons for the disproportionately high proportion of people of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent in disadvantaged social and economic conditions, and stands in the way of a fair implementation of affirmative action. Latino, a race-neutral term with historical roots, has been suggested as an alternative to be used in conjunction with national origin or regional forms of self-identification. In this article, I argue that any standardized terminology is unavoidably flawed and conducive to the development of racist or, at best, trivial stereotypical analysis of the data thus produced. The ""Hispanic"" label does not identify an ethnic group or a minority group, but a heterogeneous population whose characteristics and behavior cannot be understood without necessarily falling into stereotyping. The label should be abandoned; social scientists and policy makers should, instead, acknowledge the existence of six aggregates, qualitatively different in their socioeconomic stratification, needs, and form of integration in the U.S. economy: two minority groups (people of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent), and four immigrant populations (Cubans, Central American refugees, Central American immigrants, and South American immigrants)."

Using a phenomenological approach, we focus on processes of classification to analyze the criteria that members of the African American elite mobilize to compare racial groups and establish their equality. We first summarize results from earlier work on the antiracist strategies of White and African American workers. Second, drawing upon in-depth interviews with members of the Black elite, we show that demonstrating intelligence and competence, and gaining knowledge, are particularly valued strategies of equalization, while religion has a subordinate role within their antiracist repertoire. Thus, gaining cultural membership is often equated with educational and occupational attainment. Antiracist strategies that value college education and achievement by the standards of American individualism may exclude many poor and working-class African Americans from cultural membership. In this way, strategies of equalization based on educational and professional competence may prove dysfunctional for racial solidarity."

To address this issue, the study makes three claims. First, despite the vibrancy of national cultures within Europe, there is an emergent cultural configuration that unites the continent. Second, the applicant states are very much part of this European cultural zone. In fact, with the cultural characteristics of the original six members of the EC held up as the European model, the applicant states are closer on several dimensions than are the later entrants into the EC. Third, there are greater incentives for individuals in the applicant states to co-ordinate culturally with the European configuration than for individuals living in the heart of Europe. The conclusion therefore is that there is no evidence of a cultural divide that would justify holding back membership of Eastern European states into the EU."

This theoretical distinction helps explain the unexpected growth in the long stigmatized self-identified indigenous population in Mexico, which has tripled since 2000. Using a demographic projection model, the authors find that natural demographic processes contributed little to this sudden growth. Instead, using experimental and census data, they find that transitory crossing into the indigenous category was activated by phrasing changes to the 2010 census identification question. The authors theorize that durable crossing is being simultaneously activated by the growing salience of the indigenous movement and the Mexican government’s embrace of multiculturalism.

Both the probabilistic view and the classical view assume that categorization is driven by similarity relations. A major problem with describing category structure in terms of similarity is that the notion of similarity is too unconstrained to give an account of conceptual coherence. The second major shift is from the idea that concepts are organized by similarity to the idea that concepts are organized around theories. In this article, the evidence and rationale associated with these shifts are described, and one means of integrating similarity-based and theory-driven categorization is outlined."

W2066955143,1468-7968,['Edward H. Spicer'],"I have indicated here some features of a kind of entity which I have called a cultural identity system, and I have focused on a variety of this general type-the persistent system. In general terms it is best described as a system of beliefs and sentiments concerning historical events. I suggest using the term ""a people"" for the human beings who, at any given time, hold beliefs of this kind. These are phenomena with which we have been long familiar, but they have not been systematically studied by any but a few investigators. I have emphasized that a persistent system is a cumulative cultural phenomenon, an open-ended system that defines a course of action for the people believing in it. Such peoples are able to maintain continuity in their experience and their conception of themselves in a wide variety of sociocultural environments. I hold that certain kinds of identifiable conditions give rise to this type of cultural system. These may best be summarized as an oppositional process involving the interactions of individuals in the environment of a state or a similar large-scale organization. The oppositional process frequently produces intense collective consciousness and a high degree of internal solidarity. This is accompanied by a motivation for individuals to continue the kind of experience that is ""stored"" in the identity system in symbolic form. The persistent identity system is more stable as a cultural structure than are large-scale political organizations. When large-scale states disintegrate, they often appear to decompose into cultural systems of the persistent type. Large-scale organizations also give rise to the kind of environment that can result in the formation of new persistent systems. It is possible that, while being formed, states depend for their impetus on the accumulated energy of persistent peoples. A proposition for consideration is that states tend to dissipate the energy of peoples after transforming that energy into state-level integrations, and then regularly break down in the absence of mechanisms for maintaining human motivations in the large-scale organizations that they generate."

We reexamine the issue of phenotypic discrimination against Mexicans in the U.S. labor market, originally studied by Telles and Murguia (1990) and later by Bohara and Davila (1992). We also seek to explain this topic with respect to the Puerto Rican and Cuban populations in the United States. Methods. Instead of using household income as a dependent variable, we use occupational ranking scores computed by Hauser and Warren (1996) in combination with data from the 1990 Latino National Political Survey (LNPS). The occupational rankings more accurately reflect the level of labor market discrimination faced by individuals. Furthermore, the use of the more recent LNPS allows us to update the work of previous scholars and extend the analysis to two previously unexamined Latino groups—Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Results. Our findings indicate that darker-skinned Mexicans and Cubans face significantly lower occupational prestige scores than their lighter-skinned counterparts even when controlling for factors that influence performance in the labor market. However, we find no conclusive evidence that skin-color differences impact occupational prestige scores for Puerto Ricans. Conclusions. Using earlier data, some scholars found evidence for difference in labor market performance among Mexican Americans as a function of phenotypic variations among Mexican Americans. Today, dark-skinned Mexican Americans and Cuban Americans continue to face higher levels of discrimination in the labor market, whereas dark-skinned Puerto Ricans do not, which may indicate regional differences across the three groups that need to be controlled for."

This book encourages readers to look more closely at the issues of violence, ethnicity and the state by focusing on specific instances of violence in their local contexts and questioning the prevailing interpretations of them. Through five case studies of both rural and urban public violence, including police-public confrontations and Hindu-Muslim riots, this book shows how, out of many possible interpretations applicable to these incidents, governments and the media select those that support existing relations of power in state and society. Adopting different modes (narrator, detective and social scientist) Brass treats incidents of collective violence arising intitially out of such common occurences as a drunken brawl, the rape of a woman and the theft of an idol, and demonstrates how some incidents remain localized whilst others are fit into broader frameworks of meaning, thereby becoming useful for upholders of dominant ideologies. He argues that incessant talk about violence and its implications in these circumstances contributes to its persistence rather than to its reduction. Such treatment, he claims, serves in fact to mask the causes of violence, displace the victims from the centre of attention and divert society's gaze from those responsible for its endemic character. He explains how this process ultimately implicates everyone in the perpetuation of systems of violence."

W1994501915,0038-4038,['Sun-Ki Chai'],". Despite widespread agreement that ethnic boundaries are malleable rather than fixed, theories of ethnicity and collective action have been unable to adequately explain why individuals choose to mobilise collectively within particular boundaries rather than others. The boundaries of groups engaging in ethnic collective action are always taken for granted at some level rather than problematised. This leads to an undesirable reification of ethnic groups as actors.



The theory presented in this article integrates a social psychological view of motivation with a rational choice view of action to provide a systematic way of predicting the boundary location of ethnic groups that begin to mobilise in societies undergoing modernising structural change. It first focuses on the link between cooperation and altruism in small communities. It then predicts how altruistic preferences, in conjunction with structural factors and rational behaviour, will generate boundaries for larger-scale ethnic collective action that transcends yet incorporates such communities. The theory's predictions are then applied to explain the location of group boundaries in four very prominent cases of ethnicity ‘creation’ and collective action in this century."

This question has since been used in many sources. It was later supplemented by a question on each parent's birthplace so that the children of immigrants could be identified. More recently, direct questions on ethnic origin have been introduced. One notable exception to the use of a direct question is the census, which for political reasons has so far been unable to include such a question. The Home Affairs Committee recommended that a direct question be asked in the next census, and also recommended a form of that question. This recommended form is technically poor. In light of the political objections to a direct question, there is a need to address political issues rather than dwell on technical detail."

Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes. The implications of these findings for racial inequality and research on multiracial groups are discussed."

W2015438768,0027-8424,['Rose Laub Coser'],"The tendency for many girls to be less proficient in mathematics than boys is accounted for by their anticipated family roles, i.e., by the cultural mandate that they be primarily committed to thegemeinschaft of the family. This encourages them to focus on the practical affairs of everyday life rather than to venture out to the hypothetical. Being tied to thegemeinschaft also means that they stay close to home, making less use of physical space, and therefore remaining inhibited in their spatial conceptualization. The restriction in the use of physical space together with their commitment to thegemeinschaft restricts their social space as well, i.e., helps keep their social relationships on a simple rather than on a complex level, thereby limiting their universalistic relationships in favor of particularistic ones. The three factors—concern with the practical, limited use of physical space, and the emphasis on particularistic relationships—combine to discourage the taste, and perhaps even the capacity, for the abstract thinking which is most needed in mathematics. “I argue that the higher intellectual faculties ... have evolved as an adaptation to the complexities of social living...”

W4255257443,0021-8294,['Rogers Brubaker'],"The birthplace of the nation-state and modern nationalism at the end of the eighteenth century, Europe was supposed to be their graveyard at the end of the twentieth. Yet, far from moving beyond the nation-state, fin-de-siècle Europe has been moving back to the nation-state, most spectacularly with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia into a score of nationally defined successor states. This massive reorganisation of political space along national lines has engendered distinctive, dynamically interlocking, and in some cases explosive forms of nationalism. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu and the 'new institutionalist' sociology, and comparing contemporary nationalisms with those of interwar Europe, Rogers Brubaker provides a theoretically sophisticated and historically rich account of one of the most important problems facing the 'New Europe'."
W2132585345,0141-9870,['Eduardo Bonilla-Silva'],"study of race and ethnic conflict historically has been hampered by inadequate and simplistic theories. I contend that the central problem of the various approaches to the study of racial phenomena is their lack of a structural theory of racism. I review traditional approaches and alternative approaches to the study of racism, and discuss their limitations. Following the leads suggested by some of the alternative frameworks, I advance a structural theory of racism based on the notion of racialized social systems. The habit of considering racism as a mental quirk, as a psychological flaw, must be abandoned. -Frantz Fanon (1967:77) he area of race and ethnic studies lacks a _ sound theoretical apparatus. To complicate matters, many analysts of racial matters have abandoned the serious theorization and reconceptualization of their central topic: racism. Too many social analysts researching racism assume that the phenomenon is selfevident, and therefore either do not provide a definition or provide an elementary definition (Schuman, Steeh, and Bobo 1985; Sniderman and Piazza 1993). Nevertheless, whether implicitly or explicitly, most analysts regard racism as a purely ideological phenomenon."

Extending Blumer's reasoning, we hypothesize that such perceptions are driven by a group's feelings of racial alienation within the larger social order The more that members of a particular racial group feel collectively oppressed and unfairly treated by society, the more likely they are to perceive members of other groups as potential threats. We also examine whether such perceptions spring from simple self-interest, orthodox prejudice such as negative feelings and stereotyping, or broad beliefs about social stratification and inequality. We use data from the 1992 Los Angeles County Social Survey, a large multiracial sample of the general population, to analyze the distribution and social and psychological underpinnings of perceived group competition. Our results support the racial alienation hypothesis as well as the hypotheses positing effects for self-interest, prejudice, and stratification beliefs. We argue that Blumer's group-position framework offers the most parsimonious integration and interpretation of the social psychological processes involved in the formation of perceptions of group threat and competition.

In the 1920s, the Bolshevik government, seeking to defuse nationalist sentiment, created tens of thousands of national territories. It trained new national leaders, established national languages, and financed the production of national-language cultural products.This was a massive and fascinating historical experiment in governing a multiethnic state. Terry Martin provides a comprehensive survey and interpretation, based on newly available archival sources, of the Soviet management of the nationalities question. He traces the conflicts and tensions created by the geographic definition of national territories, the establishment of dozens of official national languages, and the world's first mass ""affirmative action"" programs. Martin examines the contradictions inherent in the Soviet nationality policy, which sought simultaneously to foster the growth of national consciousness among its minority populations while dictating the exact content of their cultures; to sponsor national liberation movements in neighboring countries, while eliminating all foreign influence on the Soviet Union's many diaspora nationalities. Martin explores the political logic of Stalin's policies as he responded to a perceived threat to Soviet unity in the 1930s by re-establishing the Russians as the state's leading nationality and deporting numerous ""enemy nations."""

Gould'],"Challenging the widely held belief that Nicaragua has been ethnically homogeneous since the nineteenth century, To Die in This reveals the continued existence and importance of an officially forgotten indigenous culture. Jeffrey L. Gould argues that mestizaje--a cultural homogeneity that has been hailed as a cornerstone of Nicaraguan national identity--involved a decades-long process of myth building.Through interviews with indigenous peoples and records of the elite discourse that suppressed the expression of cultural differences and rationalized the destruction of Indian communities, Gould tells a story of cultural loss. Land expropriation and coerced labor led to cultural alienation that shamed the indigenous population into shedding their language, religion, and dress. Beginning with the 1870s, Gould historicizes the forces that prompted a collective movement away from a strong identification with indigenous cultural heritage to an acceptance of a national mixed-race identity.By recovering a significant part of Nicaraguan history that has been excised from the national memory, To Die in This Way critiques the enterprise of third world nation-building and thus marks an important step in the study of Latin American culture and history that will also interest anthropologists and students of social and cultural historians."

Focusing on poor indigenous villages in Mexico's authoritarian regime, the book shows that the spread of US Protestant missionaries and the competition for indigenous souls motivated the Catholic Church to become a major promoter of indigenous movements for land redistribution and indigenous rights. The book explains why the outbreak of local rebellions, the transformation of indigenous claims for land into demands for ethnic autonomy and self-determination, and the threat of a generalized social uprising motivated national elites to democratize. Drawing on an original dataset of indigenous collective action and on extensive fieldwork, the empirical analysis of the book combines quantitative evidence with case studies and life histories."
W1985618956,0003-1224,['Stephen Cornell'],"Abstract This article attempts to disentangle the differential effects of content (what group members share) and circumstance (the situations they encounter) on ethnic processes. In contrast to much recent work in ethnic studies that pays attention primarily to the logic and process of boundary construction, the primary focus here is on what lies within the ethnic boundary, on the variable content of ethnic identities and the role content plays in patterns of ethnic persistence and change. The article proposes a typology of group attachments, suggesting that the content of collective identity varies continuously (low to high) along three dimensions: shared interests, shared institutions, shared culture. Ethnic groups vary ‐ within and across groups and over time ‐ in the degree to which each of these constitutes a basis of group attachment and, potentially at least, collective action. Furthermore, this variation has consequences, via interaction effects with circumstance, for patterns of group persistence and transformation. While circumstances constrain and shape ethnic identities, the content of those identities mediates the effect of circumstances on ethnic persistence and transformation. Group attachments based largely on shared interests, for example, tend to be more subject to the impact of circumstantial change, other things equal, than group attachments based on shared culture. The article argues that to fully understand ethnic processes, we have to understand not only the ways in which circumstance and action construct identities, but also the different kinds of identities or group ties that circumstance and action construct. It draws briefly on a number of examples to illustrate these points."

But as respondents choose their identities, they confront ethnic boundaries, or sharp division between ethnic categories, that influence the extent to which they feel free to assert any one particular identity. They respond to these boundaries by taking a symbolic approach, a Mexican American approach, a multiethnic approach to their ethnicity, and a combination of these approaches."

W2025084252,0141-9870,['Thomas J. Kelly'],"The experience of Mexico with neoliberal reforms began shortly after its suspension of debt repayments in 1982. The Mexican economy suffered greatly from the effects of the adjustment policies and external shocks that occurred in the early and mid1980s, but by the early 1990s moderate growth had returned and Mexico was viewed as a model of economic reform worthy of emulation by other nations. Even before the peso crisis of 1994, however, the high social costs associated with adjustment caused many critics to question Mexico's status as a model of reform. The decline in real wage rates and the reduction in expenditure on social services suggest that increased poverty may have been a consequence of the reforms. The performance of the agricultural sector was particularly poor, suggesting that poverty may have become even more widespread among agricultural households. This study seeks to determine if poverty did, in fact, increase among agricultural households during the period of the reforms. The empirical analysis raises questions about the distributional implications of neoliberal policies and the implications of neoliberal policy changes for sectors of the economy that previously relied heavily on public support. To examine the evolution of agricultural poverty over the period of the reforms, this study takes advantage of the existence of micro-level data on household income and expenditure from the Encuesta Nacional de IngresoGasto de los Hogares (National Household Income-Expenditure SurveyENIGH).' The existence of the ENIGH data offers an important advantage that most empirical studies on changes in the rate of poverty have not enjoyed. Most such studies have been forced to base their conclusions on inferences drawn from changes in per capita income or employment and wage rates in the formal sector. Drawing inferences in this way may well understate the change in poverty by ignoring changes in income distribution, changes in the informal sector, and changes in the distribution of income"

Our first hypothesis, based on a survey conducted in 2008, is that those Afro-Brazilians with darker skin, higher socioeconomic status, greater experiences with discrimination, and who express a sense of black-linked fate are more likely to identify as preto or negro. Relying on a 2006 survey, our second hypothesis is that Afro-Brazilians in São Paulo rather than Salvador with higher socioeconomic status and who express a sense of black-linked fate are more likely to identify as black rather than nonblack.

W2321975583,0095-182X,['William W. Winnie'],"T HE importance of separately identifying Hispanos' in population statistics for the Southwest has long been recognized by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. In 1930, enumerators were instructed to classify as those persons born in Mexico or having parents born in Mexico who were not definitely white, Indian, Negro, or members of some other race. The results were politically embarrassing and technically misleading. Strong objections were made both in this country and abroad against classifying Hispanic people as nonwhite, and, as would be expected, most of the large native Spanish-American population of native stock was omitted from the special category. Because of the difficulties with the procedure used in 1930, no effort has been made since then to directly identify Hispanos in the United States Census of Population. The population of the entire country was classified by mother tongue on a five percent sample basis in the Sixteenth Census. Data on persons of Spanish mother tongue classified only by sex, rural-urban residence, and nativity were made available for states and large cities. The count of Hispanos was much better in 1940 than in 1930, but no data were available for the study of many important characteristics of such persons. Ten years later, in 1950, white persons of Spanish surname were separately identified in coding the schedules for five Southwestern States. The distinction between persons of Spanish surname and other white persons was maintained through part of the tabulation process for those states, and separate data on persons of Spanish surname resulting from those tabulations were published in a special report.2 Reasonably complete data on the number and characteristics of Hispanos living in the Southwest became available for the first time in that report. In general, the special report on persons of Spanish surname was so well received, and has been so widely used, that present plans call for use of the surname criterion again in the 1960 Census of Population. Few data were available to evaluate the 1950 statistics on persons of Spanish surname on any grounds other than internal consistency. A table comparing the population of Mexican birth or parentage with the Spanish surname population of foreign stock was published in the report on persons of Spanish surname.3 The differences between those two groups could be true differences, rather than differences due to failure of the surname criterion. In this paper attention is focused on new statistical data collected specifically for the purpose of evaluating the surname criterion as applied to native Spanish Americans. These statistics resulted from a census-type survey conducted as a special training project under the sponsorship of the Bureau of the Census and the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico in February and March 1958. Both the field work and the technical planning of the survey were directed by the writer, under the general supervision of Dr. Calvert L. Dedrick. Approximately 3,000 individuals, one-third of whom are Hispanos, were enumerated in the survey. A question on mother tongue was asked for each of these persons, and the head of each household was classified as Spanish or non-Spanish on the basis of the respondent's answer to the question Is . .. of Spanish ancestry? Each surname was classified as Spanish or non-Spanish by the writer, who is fluent in both Spanish and English and who has spent several years studying the Hispanic population of New Mexico. This classification was entirely independent of any list. The names were also classified according to whether or not they appeared on the expanded list of approximately 7,500 Spanish surnames used in training surname coders for the 1950 census. Finally, 1 The term Hilispanos is used to include native Spanish Americans, Mexican immigrants and their descendants, Puerto Ricans in the Continental United States, and other persons of predominantly Spanish culture. The remainder of the white population is referred to here, as it is in vernacular speech in the Southwest, as Anglo or Anglo-American. 2 U. S. Bureau of the Census, U. S.

W2104540554,0013-0133,"['Dror Etzion', 'Fabrizio Ferraro']","We study institutional entrepreneurship in an emergent field by analyzing the case of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and its efforts to purposefully institutionalize the practice of sustainability reporting. We suggest that analogies affect institutionalization processes through two mechanisms. In the early stages of institutionalization, analogy operates primarily as a normative mechanism, and adoption is driven mainly by an instrumental logic. This emphasis on similarity to existing institutions stresses conformity and promotes legitimacy. Yet analogies can also have a cognitive effect on institutional design, especially once initial acceptance from the environment has been secured, by directing attention toward incongruences between the emergent institution and its analogical source. Institutional entrepreneurship can spur innovation and departure from existing institutions by highlighting limitations of the analogical source and providing a compelling value-rational argument that underscores the worth of the new institution. This theoretical contribution helps explain how analogies to existing institutional practices can both provide legitimacy to novel institutions and constitute the basis for a creative process of institutional design."
W2111956592,0046-2772,"['Eric Grodsky', 'Devah Pager']","This study is motivated by the idea that the racial gap in earnings is generated not only by individual differences but also by systematic variation in the occupational structure that attenuates or exacerbates the effects of race. Using data from the 1990 census and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, a hierarchical linear modeling approach is employed that allows the simultaneous exploration of the mechanisms of income inequality operating both within and between occupations. Among private-sector employees, striking evidence shows that racial disparities increase in both absolute and percentage terms as one moves up the occupational earnings hierarchy. The association between average occupational earnings and within-occupation racial disadvantage reveals an overlooked source of racial earnings inequality which constrains the opportunities available to upwardly mobile black men in the private sector. This association cannot be explained by measured individual characteristics, or by the status, demographic composition, or skill demands of occupations. In the public sector, on the other hand, racial inequality in earnings is not systematically associated with average occupational earnings, and is instead more closely tied to individual human capital and occupational placement. The implications of these results are considered and directions for future research are suggested."

Such efforts assume that data obtained through these methods can be generalized to other situations in the person’s life, even to subsequent years or stages in the life course. Self-concept is a structural product of reflexive activity, but it is also susceptible to change as the individual encounters new roles, situations, and life transitions. The data reviewed in this paper suggest that: (i) self-evaluation generally becomesm oref avorable through the life-span; (ii) self-evaluation is represented by a “moving baseline” from which situational fluctuations emerge; (iii) self-concept is characterized by both stability and change over the life course; and (iv) environmental stability plays an important role in self-concept stability.

In some cases, it is problematic whether nationhood has even yet been achieved. Four problems involved in dating the emergence of a nation are: (1) national consciousness is a mass not an élite phenomenon, and the masses, until quite recently semi‐ or totally illiterate, were quite mute with regard to their sense of group identity(ies); (2) nation‐formation is a process, not an occurrence, and the point in the process at which a sufficient number has internalized the national identity in order to cause nationalism to become an effective force for mobilizing the masses does not lend itself to precise calculation; (3) the process of nation‐formation is not sequentially pre‐ordained, but capable of terminating at any point; and (4) the sense of constituting an ancestrally related people, which is central to the sense of nationhood, seldom has much relationship to fact, so that the ethnographic history of a people is often of little pertinence to the study of nation‐formation."

The eight different questionnaires were administered to random subsamples of six “targeted” populations: geographic areas with ethnic concentrations of whites, blacks, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. The major conclusion is that allowing multiple responses to the “race” question in the 2000 census (and other variations in measurement that were considered in RAETT) had only a slight impact on the measured racial composition of the population. Another finding was a dramatic reduction in nonresponse to the combined race/Hispanic-origin question relative to all other questionnaire formats. We conclude that the concept of “origins” may be closer to the popular understanding of American diversity than is the antiquated concept of race."

Since American Indians experience very high rates of misclassification, we use them as our case in point. Drawing from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, our analyses compare young American Indian adults who are perceived as another race by an observer to those who are correctly classified, using several indicators of psychological distress: depression, suicidal thoughts, use of psychological counseling services, suicide attempts, and fatalism. We also investigate differences in racial attitudes and behaviors, such as belonging to an ethnic solidarity organization or believing it is important to have a committed relationship with someone of the same race. The evidence suggests that, onthe whole, misclassified American Indians have higher rates of psychological distress. We conclude by discussing our findings and their wider implications, especially in the context of an increasingly heterogeneous and multiracial society."

Extending research on ‘‘identity work’’ (Snow and Anderson 1987), we explore the strategies biracial people use to conceal (i.e., pass), cover, and/or accent aspects of their racial ancestries, and the individual and structural-level factors that limit the accessibility and/or effectiveness of some strategies. We further find that how these biracial respondents identify is often contextual—most identify as biracial, but in some contexts, they pass as monoracial. Scholars argue that passing may be a relic of the past, yet we find that passing still occurs today. Most notably, we find a striking reverse pattern of passing today—while passing during the Jim Crow era involved passing as white, these respondents more often report passing as black today. Motivations for identity work are explored, with an emphasis on passing as black."

Furthermore, it shows how the impact of more involved parents on their children is amplified at the class level by peer group interaction. We build on a large-scale controlled experiment run in a French deprived educational district, where parents of middle-school children were invited to participate in a simple program of parent–school meetings on how to get better involved in their children's education. At the end of the school year, we find that treated families have increased their school-and home-based involvement activities. In turn, pupils of treatment classes have developed more positive behaviour and attitudes in school, notably in terms of truancy and disciplinary sanctions (with effects-size around 15% of a standard deviation). However, test scores did not improve under the intervention. Our results suggest that parents are an input for schooling policies and it is possible to influence important aspects of the schooling process at low cost."

W2475678541,0037-7732,['Guillermo de la Peña'],"Social citizenship, understood as the exercise of a body of rights to welfare which the state — in representation of society — grants all human beings as a guarantee of their dignity, has become a key component of modern democracy (Marshall 1964).1 However, the acceptance of social citizenship was a long and difficult process. As Bryan Turner (1990) has shown, its formal recognition was not achieved merely through the benevolence of enlightened parliamentarians, but was rather a result of the struggles of organisations and parties representing the interests of less privileged classes during different historical periods. Thus, social citizenship has implied the rise and consolidation of class identities vis-à-vis a state which implements certain social policies. Over the last 30 years, in many countries across the world, including those of Latin America, a new struggle has emerged: the struggle for the right to different cultural and ethnic identities, where the latter are understood to be distinct from national identities officially proclaimed by national states. This idea has been defined as cultural citizenship (Kymlicka 1996; Pakulski 1997; Rosaldo 1997), or ethnic citizenship (de la Peña 1995 and 1999), the search for which also implies the reconfiguration of ethnic subjects themselves in the context of their relationship with the state (Sieder and Witchell 2001)."

Aun con ello, existen obstáculos metodológicos no tan fáciles de hacer a un lado. Uno de ellos está relacionado con el diseño de investigaciones que puedan producir resultados con un gran nivel de especificidad sobre un problema social de carácter nacional o regional, y a la vez con un alto grado de representatividad. Por lo general, la profundidad analítica significa el sacrificio de la generalización, y viceversa. Este trabajo constituye un análisis comparativo de dos fuentes de información con fundamentos metodológicos distintos para la medición de la migración temporal de mexicanos hacia Estados Unidos: el Proyecto sobre Migración Mexicana (Promig) y la Encuesta Nacional de la Dinámica Demográfica (Enadid). El Promig ha producido durante varios años una vasta información histórica, contextual, institucional, familiar e individual para el análisis de este fenómeno en más de 40 comunidades del país. La Enadid es una encuesta tradicional de corte transversal que recoge información sobre los factores de cambio demográfico en los niveles nacional y estatal. Mientras que la Enadid permite analizar algunas características de la migración internacional con un gran nivel de representatividad, el Promig posibilita acercarse al entendimiento de este fenómeno con una mayor profundidad y a su análisis como proceso. Nuestro análisis comparativo señala que un diseño de investigación microsocial basado en múltiples muestras de comunidades, como el propuesto por el Promig, puede contribuir a superar esta disyuntiva metodológica. Ni el análisis descriptivo de las características de la población mexicana con experiencia laboral en Estados Unidos, ni los análisis multivariados de las propensiones a viajar a Estados Unidos por motivos laborales, arrojan evidencias sobre la existencia de sesgos significativos en el Promig al comparar sus estadísticas con las de la Enadid. Si bien no es posible señalar que por ello los datos del Promig son “representativos” de la región más tradicional de la migración México-Estados Unidos, sí es posible concluir sobre los alcances de generalización de los estudios basados en los mismos. El trabajo empírico demuestra además los problemas de selectividad y especificidad en que encuestas tradicionales como la Enadid incurren por seleccionar sólo migrantes internacionales residentes en México, y por intentar capturar un proceso socioeconómico tan complejo con un número limitado de variables."
W1998461144,0003-1224,['Paul Schor'],"The US census is characterised, among other features, by the importance it gives, to this day, to race. There is an ongoing debate on the use of racial categories to underpin affirmative action policies, but their presence in the census is little discussed. This tends either to mask the functions of racial and ethnic categories in the pre-civil rights era or to lead to consideration of such categories as a mere residue of historical discrimination. Yet it would be unfortunate to write a history of such census categories that reduces them to these two functions: to identify, first, groups of non-European origin and then ‘new immigrants’ subject to official discrimination, and later their supposed descendents in order to include them within the scope of compensatory policies. Such an approach would elide the more complex and still largely neglected history of the social construction of ethnic and racial categories. This article examines several cases in which groups mobilised to demand that government agencies should take account of their existence in a different way, in a context where no material advantage was at stake. In so doing, it historicises the statistical categories of race and ethnicity, which cannot be understood solely by reference to their current usage."

Significant new research takes advantage of the data generated by the Census providing new insights to questions and claims about the meanings of mixedness and racial boundaries in the United States that were largely speculative even a decade ago. Though this review focuses primarily on issues related to how state enumeration of mixed race populations reflects and engenders particular identity and group configurations, I also discuss emerging research on interracial intimacy—intermarriage and interracial births—the phenomena from which contemporary attention to multiracial categorization and identity arise. An increasingly internationalist discussion is challenging long-held interpretations of the meaning of intermarriage and multiracial identification for understanding emergent racial formations."

In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action. The reigning model used to understand culture's effects on action is fundamentally misleading. It assumes that culture shapes action by supplying ultimate ends or values toward which action is directed, thus making values the central causal element of This paper analyzes the conceptual difficulties into which this traditional view of culture leads and offers an alternative model. Among sociologists and anthropologists, debate has raged for several academic generations over defining the term culture. Since the seminal work of Clifford Geertz (1973a), the older definition of culture as the entire way of life of a people, including their technology and material artifacts, or that (associated with the name of Ward Goodenough) as everything one would need to know to become a functioning member of a society, have been displaced in favor of defining culture as the publicly available symbolic forms through which people experience and express meaning (see Keesing, 1974).

The essential insight—that the context in which a movement emerges influences its development and potential impact—provides a fruitful analytic orientation for addressing numerous questions about social movements. Reviewing the development of the literature, however, I note that conceptualizations of political opportunity vary greatly, and scholars disagree on basic theories of how political opportunities affect movements. The relatively small number of studies testing political opportunity hypotheses against other explanations have generated mixed results, owing in part to the articulation of the theory and the specifications of variables employed. I examine conflicting specifications of the theory by considering the range of outcomes scholars address. By disaggregating outcomes and actors, I argue, we can reconcile some of the apparent contradictions and build a more comprehensive and robust theory of opportunities and social movements."

This article examines the limits of Americans' acceptance of atheists. Using new national survey data, it shows atheists are less likely to be accepted, publicly and privately, than any others from a long list of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups. This distrust of atheists is driven by religious predictors, social location, and broader value orientations. It is rooted in moral and symbolic, rather than ethnic or material, grounds. We demonstrate that increasing acceptance of religious diversity does not extend to the nonreligious, and present a theoretical framework for understanding the role of religious belief in providing a moral basis for cultural membership and solidarity in an otherwise highly diverse society."

In this paper we analyze patterns in social psychology's approach to social inequalities, which we argue has been characterized by neglect, a focus on difference rather than on similarity, a tendency toward essentialism, and a lack of attention to social context and power. We then focus in turn on the three major theoretical traditions in sociological social psychology-social exchange, social cognition, and symbolic interaction-and summarize how each has (or has not) addressed the topic of inequality. We conclude by presenting four directions for future research that we believe will move social psychology toward a clearer understanding of social inequalities. Sociological social psychological theory has developed along multiple lines throughout the twentieth century. Social cognition has mapped the structures and processes of human thought. Social exchange theory has examined the conditions under which interaction occurs and individual choices are made. Symbolic interactionism has addressed the symbolic structure of social life: how meaning is created and communicated, how self and identity develop. Although these trajectories have been productive, each has developed largely independently of the others and, to some extent, of sociological theories and concerns, a point House (1977) raised more than 20 years ago. Despite House's warning, however, this lack of theoretical cross-fertilization has continued and, we argue, has impeded the resulting generation of knowledge. Each theory contains an implicit critique of other approaches; yet because these perspectives are independent, theorists have not had to respond to these critiques.

But solving this problem has raised a new one. Marginal populations or stigmatized groups should disappear if identities were as plastic as rational theories have assumed. This article, relying on Schelling's “tipping game,” seeks to provide a rational choice basis to explain why marginal groups do not disappear as the macro outcome of a multitude of individual identity reformulations. A principal finding is that marginal groups persist to the extent that they are consigned to social roles that yield higher economic returns than an entry-level job would provide in the higher status economy. Empirical support comes from examinations of Gypsies and Jews in Europe, and untouchables in India."

Subjects gave judgments involving either interdependent allocation (resources allocated to the outgroup cannot be allocated to the ingroup) or independent allocation. The results indicated that the socio-cognitive functioning preferred by subjects varies as a function of their view of outsiders. Interdependence of judgments was more characteristic of the most xenophobic subjects, whereas the least xenophobic were more likely to reason in terms of independence. On the other hand, intermediate subjects (those who were clearly neither for nor against outsiders) were sensitive to these modalities of judgment: interdependence engendered an ingroup favoritism, while independence counteracted this bias. A second experiment further analysed the influence of a more or less imperative minority argument on the attitudes of 109 more xenophobic subjects. Independent as compared to interdependent judgment facilitated a latent influence by the source, especially when the source employed a more imperative rhetoric to urge a more favourable attitude to foreigners."

Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, parental wealth is a strong determinant of educational attainment, net of the standard indicators of socioeconomic advantage. Furthermore, the influence of parental wealth appears to be stronger among the most disadvantaged children—those with low cultural capital residing in rural areas. Second, the mechanism of parental influence on adult children’s economic well-being differs depending on the outcome: in the case of consumption level, the influence is largely indirect, mediated by offspring’s human capital, while the opposite is true for children’s asset holdings, where a direct transfer of resources predominates. Third, access to homeownership is only weakly stratified by economic resources, but parental wealth significantly affects home value. The findings here highlight the critical but largely neglected impact of wealth on inequality and mobility in Latin America."

The authors estimate the black‐white gap in hourly wages from 1980 to 1999 adjusting for the sample selection effect of labor inactivity. Among working‐age men in 1999, accounting for labor inactivity—including prison and jail incarceration—leads to an increase of 7%–20% in the black‐white wage gap. Adjusting for sample selectivity among men ages 22–30 in 1999 increases the wage gap by as much as 58%. Increasing selection bias, which can be attributed to incarceration and conventional joblessness, explains about two‐thirds of the rise in black relative wages among young men between 1985 and 1998.

The subjective understandings these youngsters have of being American, of being black American, and of their ethnic identities are described and contrasted with the identities and reactions of first-generation immigrants from the same countries. Three types of identities are evident among the second generation – a black American identity, an ethnic or hyphenated national origin identity, and an immigrant identity. These different identities are related to different perceptions and understandings of race relations and of opportunities in the United States. Those youngsters who identify as black Americans tend to see more racial discrimination and limits to opportunities for blacks in the United States. Those who identify as ethnic West Indians tend to see more opportunities and rewards for individual effort and initiative. I suggest that assimilation to America for the second-generation black immigrant is complicated by race and class and their interaction, with upwardly mobile second-generation youngsters maintaining ethnic ties to their parents’ national origins and with poor inner city youngsters assimilating to the black American peer culture that surrounds them."

The very same day, a group of leading ethnographers met at the Academy of Sciences in Petrograd to discuss a directive they had received from the Soviet of Nationalities: define nationality, determine “rational criteria” for classifying the population in the first All-Union Census, and notify the Central Statistical Administration as soon as possible. The legal formation of the Soviet Union had been completed, but the state-building process, which involved “re-imagining” the former Russian empire as a socialist federation of nationalities, was just getting under way.

The very establishment of the census category nationality marked a critical break with the tsarist regime, which had categorized its subjects on the basis of religion and native language. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists from Minsk to Vladivostok who formulated questionnaires and drew up lists of nationalities for all three censuses used their expertise to divine order out of chaos and create a new definitional grid. Not only did they have to decide which tribes, clans, and peoples belonged to which nationality, they also had to figure out what “nationality” meant."

We also examine associations of observer-ascribed skin color with three additional correlates of health – skin color discrimination, class discrimination, and socio-economic status.

Also examined is the role of anthropological research in its relation to state hegemony as well as the denunciation of indigenista policies by ethnic intellectuals and organizations. In recent decades, the dismantling of populist policies has given rise to a new official “neoliberal” discourse that extols multiculturalism.

As a result, we know little about why new census categories are defined in certain ways or how they become legitimated. This article addresses this gap by using an organizational lens to reconstruct how the Hispanic category emerged in the United States. I demonstrate that categories can become institutionalized through a two-stage process as state actors and ethnic entrepreneurs (1) negotiate a classification’s definition and (2) work together to popularize the category. I argue that cross-field effects undergird these stages—movements toward developing a new category within state agencies are reinforced by similar classification efforts occurring among social movement groups and media firms, and vice versa. I identify three organizational mechanisms that sustained these effects in the Hispanic case: the development of boundary-spanning networks between state and non-state actors, the transposition of resources across fields, and the use of analogy and ambiguity as cognitive tools to describe and legitimate the new category. I discuss the theoretical merits of incorporating organizational analysis, especially the concept of cross-field effects, into the study of racial/ethnic classification."

Solidarism is a generic term designating the closure attempts of excluded groups, whether of a class or communal nature. Because they generally lack legal or state support, solidaristic efforts are heavily dependent upon the capacity for social mobilization on the part of the excluded. The formal political expression of solidarism is of course the mass party, a movement whose social programme is generally not dissimilar from classic liberal ideals of justice as enshrined in the slogan 'equality of opportunity'.

According to this view, modern identities are responses to colonial constructions of Asian ‘tradition’. The other approach sees continuities between the late pre-colonial and early colonial periods. For these writers, the origins of modern national and communal identities lie not only in colonial interventions, but also in non-colonial eighteenth-century social formations and in early colonial interaction between the British and South Asians."

Suddenly, the topic of indigenous languages and education was brought into official discussions at the national level. This paper examines the tensions that emerge between the political discourses which emanate from within the indigenous communities and from the national government, and the actual implementation of educational policy models. The political–educational discourse shifted from Spanishization [castellanización], assimilation, and integration to bilingualism, interculturalism, and participation. We demonstrate that this shift was not a smooth transition, but rather an abrupt change that occurred in the early 1990s. Further, despite the shift to new discourses that respected indigenous languages and cultures, institutional factors have not been altered sufficiently to improve the conditions of indigenous education or their well-being in Mexico. Thus, ultimately, the new discourse of bilingualism and interculturalism in education serves to obfuscate the socio-political-economic work that must be done to truly allow the indigenous people to participate in the nation’s political life."

Initiation theories discussed were 1) macro theories of neoclassical economics; 2) micro theories of neoclassical economics; 3) the new economics with examples for crop insurance markets futures markets unemployment insurance and capital markets; 4) dual labor market theory and structural inflation motivational problems economic dualism and the demography of labor supply; and 5) world systems theory and the impacts of land raw materials labor material links ideological links and global cities.

Mathematical analysis and empirical findings based on the 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey show that linear models of the educational attainment process are stable over cohorts because their coefficients depend upon quantities which vary over time in offsetting directions. The coefficients are weighted sums of the associations between socioeconomic background and school continuation decisions where the weights are functions of the school continuation probabilities. Intercohort increases in school continuation rates by themselves imply declining background effects on educational attainment, but, over cohorts, the associations between background and continuation increase to offset the dampening effect of the changing marginal distribution of schooling.

Yet, as a chapter in this book establishes, in its modern form it is the product of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. ‘Traditions’ which appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented. Anyone familiar with the colleges of ancient British universities will be able to think of the institution of such ‘traditions’ on a local scale, though some – like the annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge on Christmas Eve – may become generalized through the modern mass medium of radio. This observation formed the starting-point of a conference organized by the historical journal Past & Present , which in turn forms the basis of the present book. The term ‘invented tradition’ is used in a broad, but not imprecise sense. It includes both ‘ traditions’ actually invented, constructed and formally instituted and those emerging in a less easily traceable manner within a brief and dateable period – a matter of a few years perhaps – and establishing themselves with great rapidity. The royal Christmas broadcast in Britain (instituted in 1932) is an example of the first; the appearance and development of the practices associated with the Cup Final in British Association Football, of the second. It is evident that not all of them are equally permanent, but it is their appearance and establishment rather than their chances of survival which are our primary concern."

There are two basic manifestations of this greater significance of religion. First, it is manifest in the nature of the fundamental distinction made by many young British Pakistanis between religion and ethnicity as sources of identity. This distinction rests on the assumption that whereas Pakistani ethnicity relates to a particular place and its people, Islam has universal relevance. The greater significance of religion is manifest, secondly, in the contrast between the essential characteristics of the social boundaries delineating the two forms of social identity.

Most infants reclassified at death (87.3%) are classified as white at death. Inconsistency in coding is lower for non-Hispanic whites (3.5%) and non-Hispanic blacks (3.3%) than for Hispanic populations (30.3%).

According to this perspective, growing up speaking two languages is beneficial because it stimulates cognitive development and allows immigrants a means of resisting unwanted assimilation. Immigrant children who are fluent bilinguals can use their nutive-language ability to maintain beneficial aspects of their ethnic culture while accommodating to the linguistic demands of an English-speaking society. Using data on first- and second-generation Asian American students from the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Study, we test for these hypothesized effects of bilingualism. We find no evidence that bilingualism per se has a positive effect on achievement. Instead, speaking a native language with parents has a temporary positive effect if the parents are not proficient in English. These results indicate that the academic importance of bilingualism is transitional: The educational benefits of delaying linguistic assimilation exist only before immigrant parents achieve a moderate level of English-language proficiency."

W1970568092,0141-9870,['Eduardo Bonilla-Silva'],"Racial stratification in the United States has operated along bi-racial lines (White–non-White) for centuries.1 For demographic (the relative large size of the Black population) and historical reasons (the centrality of Blacks to the national economic development from the 17th to the middle part of the 20th century), the bi-racial order has been anchored on the Black–White experience (Feagin, 2000). Historically, those on the non-White side of the divide have shared similar experiences of colonialism, oppression, exploitation, and racialization (Amott & Matthaei, 1991). Hence, being non-White has meant having a restricted access to the multiple benefits or “wages of whiteness” (Roediger, 1991) such as good housing, decent jobs, and a good education. Nevertheless, the post-civil rights era has brought changes in how racial stratification seems to operate. For example, significant gaps in status have emerged between groups that previously shared a common denizen position in the racial order. Asian Americans in particular have almost matched the socioeconomic standing of Whites and, in some areas (e.g., educational attainment), have surpassed them.2 For example, in selective colleges across the nation, Asian Americans are represented at 3–10 times their national proportion (U.S. News and World Report, 2003). Another example of the changes is the high rate of interracial dating and marriage between Latinos and Whites and Asians and Whites (Moran, 2001; Qian & Lichter, 2000). These interracial unions, coupled with the collapse of formal segregation, have created the political space for “multiracial activists” to force the Census Bureau in 2000 to allow respondents to pick all the races they felt apply to them (Daniels, 2002; Parker & Song, 2001). Yet another instance of the changes in contemporary America is that few Whites endorse in surveys segregationist views. This has been heralded by some as reality as “the end of racism”"

The relative restraint of immigrant Korean storekeepers in these encounters is perceived by many African Americans as a sign of racism, while the relatively personable involvement of African Americans is perceived by many storekeepers as disrespectful imposition.

Identity is concerned with group judgments and judgments about groups and their motives. This article explores identity through the case of Loyal Order Protestant parades in Northern Ireland and the concepts of psychocultural interpretations (shared, deeply held worldviews found in group narratives) and psychocultural dramas (conflicts over competing, and apparently irresolvable, claims that engage the central elements of a group's historical experience). Psychocultural dramas are polarizing events whose manifest content involves non-negotiable cultural claims, threats, and/or rights that become important because of their connections to core metaphors and group narratives that embody a group's identity. In ethnic conflicts, psychocultural dramas arise over competing claims that evoke deeply rooted dimensions of the conflict which cannot be settled by reference to more general rules or higher authority. Psychocultural dramas are tools of analysis for understanding the centrality of cultural identity and ritual in ethnic conflict and for the redefinition of such conflicts in ways that increase the chances for managing them constructively. Examining the psychocultural dramas surrounding parades disputes in Northern Ireland suggests why and how some conflicts are more amenable to constructive outcomes than others."

In some countries the discrepancy between official government statistics and the estimates provided by indigenous organizations is a matter of some debate, due largely to the public policy ramifications of under- or overestimating the size of the population. The reasons for defining an individual, a household or a population as indigenous run from the practical to the political. Estimating the size of any population is important to the development of appropriate social policies in terms of both scope and substance, for setting budgets and so on. Knowing the size of their own population is also essential to indigenous groups when making demands for better services."

In the United States, despite massive immigration, the category of « immigrant » is shrinking. Citizenship is liberally available by naturalization and by jus soli. In Germany, by contrast, citizenship is acquired on a jus sanguinis basis ; naturalization is rare ; even third generation Turks are often considered « immigrants ». Whereas to be American has little to do with blood, to be German means to be a Germon citizen and a member ofthe German ethnic group. On all of these dimensions, France and Britain are in-between. There is some genetic content to being French or British, but immigrants can, to some extent, become French or British. Although France, unlike Britain, is traditionally a country of immigration, both have had difficulty absorbing migrants from Asia and Africa. Education and housing policies affecting minorities vary from country to country. In Germany and America, both federal states, education is less uniform and more subject to local control than in France and Britain. In France and America, the schools have been traditional facilitators of immigrant acculturation and social mobility. In parts of Germany, schools have emphasized preparation of immigrant children for a return to the home country that seems unlikely. Germany has no housing policy targeted at minorities, who tend to live in poorer conditions than Germans do. Despite the absence of a policy in Britain, minority housing conditions have improved steadily. American policies have improved the access of middle-class minority group members to good housing but have done little for members of the lower class. Overall, there is no clear relation between ethnic policies and the conditions in which the minorities find themselves."

Relative to that earlier period, the present era registers a visible increase in income inequality, a persistent concentration of wealth in the top decile of the population, a rapid expansion of the class of micro-entrepreneurs, and a stagnation or increase of the informal proletariat. The contraction of public sector employment and the stagnation of formal sector labor demand in most countries have led to a series of adaptive solutions by the middle and lower classes. The rise of informal self-employment and micro-entrepreneurialism throughout the region can be interpreted as a direct result of the new adjustment policies. We explore other, less orthodox adaptive strategies, including the rise of violent crime in the cities and migration abroad by an increasingly diversified cross-section of the population.

In the context of demographic transformations and their political consequences, we find that census policy in any given year was driven by a combination of scientific, political, and ideological motivations. Based on this analysis, we rethink existing theoretical approaches to censuses and racial classification, arguing that a nation's census is deeply implicated in and helps to construct its social and political order. Censuses provide the concepts, taxonomy, and substantive information by which a nation understands its component parts as well as the contours of the whole; censuses both create the image and provide the mirror of that image for a nation's self-reflection. We conclude by outlining the meaning of this period in American history for current and future debates over race and classification."

Variation in perceived meanings along dimensions of definition, morality, or threat helps explain the speed of group inclusion, the amount of mobilization needed, and possiblity for failure. Ethnoracial minorities benefited from perceptions of definitional and moral similarity to blacks, but elites perceived women as different definitionally and white ethnics as different definitionally and morally. Policy‐elite perceptions create obstacles for some groups, forcing them to struggle longer and harder for the same policy outcome."

The technique is applied to the classification of skin colour in Brazil (white, black, brown, yellow). For the period 1950-80, the findings show a deficit of 38 per cent in the black category and a gain of 34 per cent in the brown category, suggesting that a large proportion of individuals who declared themselves black in 1950 reclassified themselves as brown in 1980. Estimates for 1980-90, adjusted for the effects of international migration, reveal a similar pattern, although the magnitude of colour reclassification may have declined somewhat during the 1980s. Procedures to determine the stability of racial/ethnic identity produce data useful to recent policy initiatives that rely on demographic censuses to measure changes in the status of minority groups in less developed countries."

This article tracks a process by which a conditional cash transfer (CCT) to mothers, begun in a Mexican programme with some pretensions to promoting gender equality, was standardized by international organizations, becoming a policy instrument characterized by gender sensitivity, but having little attention to equality. In addition to involving certification by international organizations, this standardization process framed the CCT as an instrument of social investment and was a decontextualization of the Mexican version that had been influenced by Beijing-style international feminism. The third phase of this trajectory was take-up of the standard model by Peruvian policymakers and employees of the Juntos programme who overlaid their long-standing representations of their indigenous clientele onto a supposedly ‘modern’ social policy instrument, thereby rendering it both maternalist and neo-colonial."

Puerto Ricans themselves frequently state, have no race prejudice here. For some, this assertion has become a protective device; it is intended to divert attention from what many believe causes race prejudice: the Negro blood they or fellow Puerto Ricans may possess. Others equate race violence with race prejudice; finding the first absent, they may claim the second absent also. We have shown elsewhere, however, that race prejudice in Puerto Rico is widespread.' In the present report, we will consider this prejudice as conditioned by the specific Puerto Rican cultural heritage. We will also examine new and external factors which have contributed to, and altered, Puerto Rico's prejudice pattern. Although relatively few Americans2 are familiar with either Puerto Rico or its race problems, the Puerto Rican has ample knowledge of race discrimination in the United States. Many Americans who come to Puerto Rico demonstrate behavior towards the islander which he correctly identifies as prejudical. Puerto Ricans who live in or have visited the U.S. often experience race discrimination directly. They also experience it in other U.S. possessions in the Caribbean to which many have emigrated in recent times.3 A. A. Campbell states in his study of St. Thomas (one of the U.S. Virgin Islands):"

We seek to explain this norm of interethnic peace and how it occasionally breaks down, arguing that formal and informal institutions usually work to contain or “cauterize” disputes between individual members of different groups. Using a social matching game model, we show that local-level interethnic cooperation can be supported in essentially two ways. In spiral equilibria , disputes between individuals are correctly expected to spiral rapidly beyond the two parties, and fear of this induces cooperation “on the equilibrium path.” In in-group policing equilibria , individuals ignore transgressions by members of the other group, correctly expecting that the culprits will be identified and sanctioned by their own ethnic brethren. A range of examples suggests that both equilibria occur empirically and have properties expected from the theoretical analysis."
W2035707119,1744-2222,['John Rawls'],"Thus, when justice as fairness begins from the fundamental intuitive idea of society as a fair system of cooperation and proceeds to elaborate that idea, the resulting conception of political justice may be said to be abstract. It is abstract in the same way that the conception of a perfectly competitive market, or of general economic equilibrium, is abstract: that is, it singles out, or focuses on, certain aspects of society as especially significant from the standpoint of political justice and leaves others aside. But whether the conception that results itself is general and comprehensive, as I have used those terms, is a separate question. I believe the conflicts implicit in the fact of pluralism force political philosophy to present conceptions of justice that are abstract, if it is to achieve its aims; but the same conflicts prevent those conceptions from being general and comprehensive.

Here the criterion of a just regime is specified by that political conception; and the values in question are seen from its principles and standards, and from its account of the cooperative virtues of political justice, and the like. Those who hold this conception have, of course, other views as well, views that specify values and virtues belonging to other parts of life; they differ from citizens holding the two other views in our example of an overlapping consensus in having no fully (as opposed to partially)25 comprehensive doctrine within which they see all values and virtues as being ordered. They don't say such a doctrine is impossible, but rather practically speaking unnecessary. Their conviction is that, within the scope allowed by the basic liberties and the other provisions of a just constitution, all citizens can pursue their way of life on fair terms and properly respect its (non-public) values. So long as those constitutional guarantees are secure, they think no conflict of values is likely to arise that would justify their opposing the political conception as a whole, or on such fundamental matters as liberty of conscience, or equal political liberties, or basic civil rights, and the like. Those holding this partially comprehensive view might explain it as follows. We should not assume that there exist reasonable and generally acceptable answers for all or even for many questions of political justice that might be asked. Rather, we must be prepared to accept the fact that only a few such questions can be satisfactorily resolved. Political wisdom consists in identifying those few, and among them the most urgent. That done, we must frame the institutions of the basic structure so that intractable conflicts are unlikely to arise; we must also accept the need for clear and simple principles, the general form and content of which we hope can be publicly understood. A political conception is at best but a guiding framework of deliberation and reflection which helps us reach political agreement on at least the constitutional essentials. If it seems to have cleared our view and made our considered convictions more coherent; if it has narrowed the gap between the conscientious convictions of those who accept the basic ideas of a constitutional regime, then it has served its practical political purpose. And this remains true even though we can't fully explain our agreement: we know only that citizens who affirm the political conception, and who have been raised in and are familiar with-the fundamental ideas of the public political culture, find that, when they adopt its framework of deliberation, their judgments converge sufficiently so that political cooperation on the basis of mutual respect can be maintained. They view the political conception as itself normally sufficient and may not expect, or think they need, greater political understanding than that. 25 For the distinction between a doctrine's being fully vs partially comprehensive, see footnote 23 in Sec IV.

W2124800409,0044-7471,"['Zhenchao Qian', 'Daniel T. Lichter']","Interracial/interethnic marriage in America is a barometer of racial/ethnic relations and intergroup social distance. Using data from the 5-percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the 1990 and 2000 censuses, we interpret trends in intermarriage in light of new assimilation theory, recent changes in racial classification, and rapid demographic changes in American society. Our results indicate that changes in marital assimilation have taken on momentum of their own; that is, America's growing biracial population has fueled the growth of interracial marriages with whites. Analyses also shed new light on the effects of rapid immigration, rising cohabitation, and educational upgrading on intermarriage patterns, and yield both continuities and departures from the past. Historic patterns of racial/ethnic differences in intermarriage persist—Hispanics and American Indians are most likely to marry whites, followed closely by Asian Americans. African Americans are least likely to marry whites. Yet, the 1990s brought significant increases in intermarriage between blacks and whites; large increases in cohabitation did not offset the growth of racially-mixed marriages. The past decade also ushered in unprecedented declines in intermarriage with whites and large increases in marriage between native- and foreign-born co-ethnics among Hispanics and Asian Americans. The role of educational attainment in the out-marriage patterns of Hispanics and Asian Americans was also reinforced. Any evidence of differential growth in African American-white marriages among the highly educated African American population was weak. If intermarriage is our guide, any shifting, blurring, or crossing of racial/ethnic boundaries represent uncommonly weak mechanisms for breaking down existing racial barriers to black-white union formation."

W2160062079,0002-9602,['Howard Winant'],"Race has always been a significant sociological theme, from the founding of the field and the formulation of classical theoretical statements to the present. Since the nineteenth century, sociological perspectives on race have developed and changed, always reflecting shifts in large-scale political processes. In the classical period, colonialism and biologistic racism held sway. As the twentieth century dawned, sociology came to be dominated by US-based figures. DuBois and the Chicago School presented the first notable challenges to the field's racist assumptions. In the aftermath of World War II, with the destruction of European colonialism, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the surge in migration on a world scale, the sociology of race became a central topic. The field moved toward a more critical, more egalitarian awareness of race, focused particularly on the overcoming of prejudice and discrimination. Although the recognition of these problems increased and political reforms made some headway in combatting them, racial injustice and inequality were not surmounted. As the global and domestic politics of race entered a new period of crisis and uncertainty, so too has the field of sociology. To tackle the themes of race and racism once again in the new millennium, sociology must develop more effective racial theory. Racial formation approaches can offer a starting point here. The key tasks will be the formulation of a more adequate comparative historical sociology of race, the development of a deeper understanding of the micro-macro linkages that shape racial issues, and the recognition of the pervasiveness of racial politics in contemporary society. This is a challenging but also exciting agenda. The field must not shrink from addressing it."

W2106355711,0001-8392,['Marc Schneiberg'],"Institutionalists commonly invoke exogenous shocks or the transposition of logics across national systems to explain institutional change and new path creation. Using organizational data on American infrastructure industries, this paper shows instead how established institutional paths contain within them possibilities and resources for transformation and off-path organization. Even settled paths are typically littered with flotsam and jetsam - with elements of alternative economic orders and abandoned or partly realized institutional projects. These elements of 'paths not taken' are legacies of constitutional struggles and movements for alternative forms of order whose settlement or defeat help fix the path that triumphed. Moreover, they represent resources for endogenous institutional change, including the revival, reassembly, redeployment and subsequent elaboration of alternative logics within national capitalisms. As the analysis of the US case shows, such legacies underwrote the construction of an entirely different, cooperatively organized path alongside the dominant path of impersonal markets and for-profit corporations. Taken together, these findings generate new leverage for explaining institutional change. They also highlight features of the US case that have been ignored by institutionalist and 'varieties of capitalism' research, including internal structural variety, endogenous change processes, and the co-evolution of cooperative or coordinated and liberal market economies within American capitalism."
W2017852859,0956-7976,['Tariq Modood'],"In the 1980s a political concept of blackness was hegemonic, but is increasingly having to be defended, even within the sociology of race. This is to be welcomed and seven reasons are given why the concept harms British Asians. The use of `black' encourages a `doublespeak'. It falsely equates racial discrimination with colour-discrimination and thereby obscures the cultural antipathy to Asians and therefore of the character of the discrimination they suffer. `Black' suggests also a false essentialism: that all non-white groups have something in common other than how others treat them. The fourth reason is that `black', being evocative of people of African origins, understates the size, needs and distinctive concerns of Asian communities. Fifthly, while the former can use the concept for purposes of ethnic pride, for Asians it can be no more than `a political colour', leading to a too politicised identity. Indeed, it cannot but smother Asian ethnic pride-the pride which is a precondition of group mobilisation and assertiveness. Finally, advocates of `black' have tried to impose it on Asians rather than seek slower methods of persuasion, with the result that the majority of Asians continue to reject it. The new emphasis on multi-textured identities is therefore encouraging, as long as we are not simply exchanging a political for a cultural vanguardism."

This volume is 1 of a series aimed at converting the vast statistical yield of the 1980 census into authoritative analyses of major changes and trends in American life. FROM MANY STRANDS focuses on each of the 16 principal European ethnic groups as well as on major non-European groups such as Blacks Asians American Indians and Hispanics. The authors describe the differences and similarities across a range of dimensions including regional distribution and metropolitan composition income and occupation marriage patterns and education. Some findings lend support to the melting pot theory of assimilation; levels of educational attainment have become more comparable and in-group marriage is declining. Other findings suggest the persistence of pluralism; settlement patterns resist change ethnicity continues to influence marital choice and some current occupational patterns date from the turn of the century. These contradictions coupled with the striking number of respondents who incorrectly report their ethnic background provide evidence of considerable ethnic flux and suggest the growing presence of a new ethnic strand in American life.
W2330008435,0039-6338,['Arthur L. Stinchcombe'],"Plantations, especially sugar plantations, created slave societies and a racism persisting well into post-slavery periods: so runs a familiar argument that has been used to explain the sweep of Caribbean history. Here one of the most eminent scholars of modern social theory applies this assertion to a comparative study of most Caribbean islands from the time of the American Revolution to the Spanish American War. Arthur Stinchcombe uses insights from his own much admired Economic Sociology to show why sugar planters needed the help of repressive governments for recruiting disciplined labour. Demonstrating that island-to-island variations on this theme were a function of geography, local political economy, and relation to outside powers, he scrutinises Caribbean slavery and Caribbean emancipation movements in a world-historical context. Throughout the book, Stinchcombe aims to develop a sociology of freedom that explains a number of complex phenomena, such as how liberty for some individuals may restrict the liberty of others. Thus, the autonomous governments of colonies often produced more oppressive conditions for slaves than did so-called arbitrary governments, which had the power to restrict the whims of the planters. Even after emancipation, freedom was not a clear-cut matter of achieving the ideals of the Enlightenment. Indeed, it was often a route to a social control more efficient than slavery, providing greater flexibility for the planter class and posing less risk of violent rebellion."

Survey data from 901 community health center patients, who were potential and actual participants in these programs, indicated that while images of the Medicaid program and its recipients were generally positive, stigma associated with welfare stereotypes reduced both TANF and Medicaid enrollment. Expectations of poor treatment when applying for Medicaid, enrollment barriers, and misinformation about program rules were also associated with reduced Medicaid enrollment. States that enacted strict welfare reform policies were potentially decreasing TANF participation, while states with more simplified and generous programs were potentially increasing Medicaid participation. The results suggest that the image of the adult Medicaid program remains tied to perceptions about welfare and provides guidance to policymakers about how to improve participation rates. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management."

A content analysis of the war discourse in the editorials of the five leading German newspapers investigates the range of evaluations of the Kosovo war.

Controversial debate emerged around the procedural aspects of warfare. While the conservative papers emphasized the military options, the liberal papers directed attention to humanitarian and diplomatic efforts. Yet, the legitimacy of the war was hardly contested in any of the national prestige papers.

This question was examined in a field setting, using experiential sampling techniques in which participants carried an electronic timer for two days as they engaged in their normal activities on a college campus. When the timer signalled them, participants responded to a questionnaire concerning who they were with, what they were doing, what identities and roles they were involved in at the time, and what their perceptions were of the situation. From the work of Burke and Reitzes, which postulates that people behave in ways that conform to the meanings of their identities (the principle of semantic congruity), we hypothesized that the particular meaning of respondents' identities in situations would conform to the meaning of the situations in which the identity was held. Analyses of the data indicated strong support for this hypothesis. How people view themselves depends on how they view the situation they are in, and how they behave depends on how they view themselves."
